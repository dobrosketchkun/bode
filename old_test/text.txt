Зверская ферма

Владимир Прибыловский, перевод с английского

...В знаменитой сказке Джорджа Оруэлла "Зверская Ферма", написанной в 1943-44гг, угнетенные животные "Барской Фермы" устраивают Восстание, изгоняют жестокого фермера Джонса, меняют название фермы и пытаются устроить жизнь на основах новой справедливой теории - Зверизма, придуманной старым хряком Майором.

На стенке гумна восставшие пишут Семь Заповедей, в согласии с которыми они отныне будут жить: "Все звери равны", "Зверь да не убьет другого зверя", "Зверь не пьет спиртного" и т.п.

Двуногие во главе с фермером Фредериком устраивают нападение на Зверскую Ферму, но терпят поражение.

Ученик Майора Наполеон и другие свиньи постепенно перенимают все пороки человечества, а после победы над Фредериком даже пытаются встать на задние ножки...

Оруэлл умер в 1950 году и не видел, чем все это кончилось. История Фермы с тех пор и по наши дни - в "Зверской Ферме-2" от переводчика.

Глава первая

Владелец Барской Фермы мистер Джонс позапирал на ночь курятники, но о цыплячьих лазах спьяну забыл. Пошатываясь и рисуя на земле петли лучом света от фонарика, он пересек двор, скинул сапоги у заднего крыльца, нацедил себе еще одну кружку пива из бочонка в буфетной при кухне и завалился на кровать, в которой уже похрапывала миссис Джонс.

Лишь только свет в спальне погас, вся усадьба пришла в движение. Еще днем по ферме пронесся слух, будто прошлой ночью старый Майор, премированный хряк средней белой породы, видел поразительный сон и желает поведать о нем другим животным. Договорились собраться на большом гумне, как только мистер Джонс благополучно выйдет из строя. Старый Майор, которого Майором называли все, хотя выставлялся он под кличкой "Краса Виллингдона", - пользовался огромным уважением на ферме, и, чтобы его послушать, всякий был готов оторвать ото сна часок-другой.

Майор уже восседал на груде соломы, на помосте, устроенном в глубине большого гумна, под лампой, которая свисала с балки. Ему было уже двенадцать лет, в последние время его порядком разнесло, но он все еще смотрелся величественно и, хотя клыки ему не подпиливали, вид у него был кроткий и благообразный. Постепенно на гумне стали собираться и остальные животные, располагаясь поудобнее, каждое на свой лад. Первыми прибежали три собаки: Блюбель, Джесси и Пинчер, а потом свиньи, которые разлеглись на соломе перед самым помостом. Куры расселись на подоконниках, голуби вспорхнули на стропила, овцы и коровы улеглись сразу за свиньями и принялись за свою жвачку. Две ломовые лошади Боксер и Кашка вошли вместе и передвигались с величайшей осторожностью, расставляя свои огромные мохнатые копыта медленно и внимательно, чтобы не дай бог не задеть какую-нибудь не заметную в соломе мелюзгу.

Кашка, полная кобыла средних лет, была по-матерински добра со всеми. После рождения четвертого по счету жеребенка она уже не восстановила своей фигуры. Боксер, здоровенный конь чуть не двухметрового роста, был вынослив как две обычные лошади вместе взятые. Белая черточка под носом придавала ему немножко глуповатый вид, да он и в самом деле был не слишком умен, но пользовался всеобщим уважением за твердый характер и огромную работоспособность.

За лошадьми появились белая козочка Мюриель и осел Бенджамин. Бенджамин был старше всех на ферме и славился злонравным характером. Говорил он очень мало, а если и открывал рот, то только ради того, чтобы ляпнуть какую-нибудь непристойную гадость. Однажды, например, он сказал: "Бог дал мне этот хвост, чтоб я гонял им мух. Лучше б он избавил меня и от того, и от другого". В отличие от других обитателей фермы он никогда не смеялся. Если его спрашивали почему, то он отвечал, что не видит вокруг ничего смешного. Не признаваясь в этом вслух, он, однако, питал слабость к Боксеру: они часто проводили воскресные дни вдвоем на небольшой лужайке за фруктовым садом, где паслись бок о бок, никогда не разговаривая.

Лошади как раз устраивались поудобнее, когда на гумно гуськом ввалился потерявший свою мамашу выводок утят, которые слабо попискивали и бросались то туда, то сюда в поисках места, где бы их не затоптали. Кашка вытянула ноги и огородила ими утят. Почувствовав себя в безопасности, утята сразу же заснули.

В последнюю минуту, изящно семеня копытцами и похрустывая кусочком сахара, вбежала красотка Молли, глупенькая белая кобылка, обычно возившая двуколку мистера Джонса. Она заняла место поближе к помосту и принялась потряхивать своей белой гривой, желая привлечь внимание к заплетенным в нее красными ленточкам. И самая последняя явилась кошка. Она огляделась, по обыкновению выискивая уголок потеплее, и, наконец, втиснулась между Боксером и Кашкой, где удовлетворенно промурлыкала в течение всей Майоровой речи, пропустив мимо ушей все до единого слова.

Теперь, наконец, были в сборе все животные фермы, кроме ручного ворона Моисея, дремавшего на шесте у задней калитки. Лишь только Майор удостоверился, что все расположились удобно и ждут его слов со вниманием, он откашлялся и заговорил:

- Товарищи! Вы все уже слышали, что вчера мне приснился удивительный сон. Но об этом позже. Сначала я хочу поведать вам вот о чем. Я чувствую, товарищи, что мой долг, прежде чем я умру, - поделиться с вами приобретенными мной жизненной мудростью и опытом, - а я не уверен, что проживу среди вас еще хотя бы несколько месяцев. Я прожил долгую жизнь и много размышлял, лежа в одиночестве в своем свинарнике. Мне кажется, что у меня есть право сказать: я понял сущность жизни на этой земле, как никто из моих современников. Вот об этом я и хочу побеседовать с вами.

В чем же, товарищи, состоит сущность нашего бытия? Давайте посмотрим правде в лицо: наша жизнь коротка, изнурительна и несчастлива. С самого появления на свет нас кормят так, чтоб мы только не подохли, и каждого из нас, у кого есть силы, заставляют работать до последнего вздоха, а как только мы становимся бесполезными, нас забивают с отвратительной жесткостью! Ни одно животное Англии в возрасте старше одного года не знает ни радостей, ни покоя. Все животные в Англии - несвободны! Правда заключается в том, что удел животных - страдания и рабский труд.

Но, может быть, таков закон природы? Может, это оттого, что наша страна так бедна, что не способна обеспечить достойную жизнь ее обитателей? Нет, товарищи, тысячу раз нет! Мягкий климат и плодородная почва Англии могут давать пропитание гораздо большему числу животных, чем населяет ее теперь. На одной нашей ферме вполне могли бы жить припеваючи, с удобствами, какие вы сейчас даже не можете себе представить, - дюжина лошадей, двадцать коров, сотни овец!

Почему же тогда мы живем так, как мы живем? Потому что почти все плоды нашего труда крадут у нас двуногие твари. Здесь, товарищи, гвоздь наших проблем! Их суть заключается в одном слове: ЧЕЛОВЕК, Человек - вот наш единственный подлинный враг. Уберите Человека - и коренная причина голода и изнурительных трудов будет устранена навеки.

Человек - единственное живое существо, которое потребляет, не производя. Он не дает молока, не несет яиц, он слишком слаб, чтобы таскать за собой плуг и бегает так медленно, что не может поймать даже кролика. Но он Бог и Царь всех домашних животных. Заставляя животных работать, он возвращает им лишь скудный прожиточный минимум - только чтобы они не околели с голоду, а все остальное присваивает себе. Наш труд возделывает землю, ее удобряет наш навоз, но ни у кого из нас нет ничего, кроме своей жалкой шкуры.

Вот вы, коровы, лежащие передо мной, сколько тысяч галлонов молока вы дали в этом году? и что стало с этим молоком, которое могло бы пойти на выкармливание крепких телят? Все оно, как в прорву, ушло в утробу Человека!

А вы, куры, сколько яиц вы снесли в этом году? и сколько цыплят высидели? Почти все яйца проданы на рынке, а деньги пошли на Джонса и его людей!

А где, Кашка, твои четыре жеребенка, которых ты выносила и родила в муках? Они могли бы стать опорой и отрадой твоей старости! Но все четверо проданы с торгов в годовалом возрасте и ни одного из них ты уже никогда не увидишь! И что, кроме стойла и охапки сена, ты получаешь в награду за все твои труды и четырех рожденных в муках жеребят?

Но и то жалкое существование, которое мы влачим, нам не дадут дотянуть до отмеренного природой срока. Что касается меня, то мне жаловаться грех. Я вхожу в число немногих счастливчиков, мне двенадцать лет, у меня было более четырехсот детей, моя судьба отвечает естественному порядку вещей. Но, как правило, каждый из нас в итоге идет под нож!

Вот вы, сидящие сейчас передо мной молоденькие поросятки! Не пройдет и года, и все вы распрощаетесь с жизнью, визжа от боли и страха на деревянной колоде! И эта ужасная участь подстерегает всех нас - коров, свиней, кур, овец - всех! Даже лошадям и собакам не миновать общей судьбы. Вот ты, Боксер, - в тот самый день, когда твое могучее здоровье оставит тебя, Джонс продаст тебя на живодерню, где тебе перережут горло, а мясо твое пойдет на кормежку гончим собакам. А вам, собаки, когда состаритесь, и зубы у вас выпадут, Джонс привяжет по кирпичу на шею и утопит в ближайшем пруду.

Разве вам не ясно теперь, товарищи, что все зло нашей жизни исходит от тирании двуногих? Стоит только избавиться от Человека, и плоды нашего труда будут принадлежать нам. Почти в тот же день мы станем богаты и свободны. Итак, что же нам следует делать? А вот что: день и ночь, душой и телом трудиться во имя освобождения от гнета человеческой расы!

Вот вам мой завет: Восстание! Я не знаю, когда Восстание грянет, быть может, уже через неделю, а, может быть, только через сотню лет, но я убежден, что справедливость рано или поздно восторжествует. Это так же верно, как то, что под ногами у меня сейчас вот эта солома. На все оставшиеся дни - сделайте Восстание целью вашей жизни. И передайте мой завет тем, кто придет после вас, - и пусть будущие поколения доведут нашу борьбу до конца!

И помните, товарищи, никаких колебаний! Никакие кривые слова не должны сбивать вас с толку! Не слушайте, когда вас станут уверять, будто у Человека и животного - общие интересы, что его процветание - это наше процветание. Все это ложь. Кроме себя самого, Человек не нужен никому.

А мы, животные, будем крепить наше единство и товарищество по борьбе. Все люди - наши враги. Все животные - соратники.

Последние слова Майора потонули вдруг в ужасном гаме. Оказывается, четыре огромные крысы незаметно выбрались из своих нор и, присев на задние лапки, тоже слушали его речь. Хотя и не сразу, но собаки все-таки учуяли их, и только стремительным бегством в норы крысы спасли свои шкуры. Майор приподнял переднее копытце, призывая к молчанию.

- Товарищи, - сказал он, - вот вопрос, который надо решить немедленно: друзья нам или враги дикие животные вроде крыс или зайцев? Давайте поставим это на голосование. Я предлагаю собранию вопрос: считать ли крыс нашими товарищами?

Голосование провели немедленно, и подавляющим большинством голосов было решено, что крысы - товарищи. Только четверо голосовали против этого: три собаки и кошка. Впрочем, как выяснилось, киска подняла лапу дважды - и за, и против.

Майор продолжал:

- Мне остается сказать немного. Я повторю: помните всегда, что ваш долг быть врагами Человека и всего образа жизни Человека. Любой двуногий - враг. Любое четвероногое, любая птица - друг. Помните, что, сражаясь против Человека, вы ничем не должны уподобляться ему. Даже когда вы одолеете его не перенимайте его пороков. Ни одно животное не должно жить в доме, спать в кровати, носить одежду, пить спиртное, курить, прикасаться к деньгам, торговать. Все обычаи Человека - зло! И самое главное: пусть животное никогда не угнетает себе подобных. Сильные и слабые, разумные и не очень все мы братья. Животные не должны убивать других животных. Все животные равны.

А теперь, товарищи, я поведаю вам свой последний сон. Передать его весь я просто не в силах. Это был сон о земле, какой она будет после исчезновения Человека. И вспомнилось мне давно позабытое. Много лет тому назад, когда я еще был поросенком-сосунком, моя мать и другие свиньи, бывало, напевали старую песню, хотя помнили только мотив, да еще три первых слова из нее. В детстве я знал эту мелодию, но с тех пор прошло много лет и она выветрилась из моей памяти. И вот эта мелодия вдруг припомнилось мне вчерашней ночью во сне. Мало того, слова песни, которые, как я уверен, сочинили животные давным-давно и которые, казалось, исчезли из памяти поколений, - слова песни я тоже вспомнил! Я спою вам эту песню, товарищи. Я стар, и голос мой хрипит, но когда вы запомните мелодию и слова, вы сами споете лучше. Она называется "Все животные Британии".

Старый Майор откашлялся и запел. Как он и предупреждал, голос у него был хриплый, но пел он совсем неплохо, и мотив у песни был бодрый, что-то среднее между "Клементиной" и "Кукарачей". Слова были таковы:

Все животные Британии,

Звери, птицы и скоты,

Верьте мне, что день настанет

И исполнит все мечты.

Мир насилья мы разрушим,

Власть двуногих упадет.

Вольно и единодушно

Будет жить свободный скот!

Знайте все: мы с вами скоро

Свергнем тяжкий гнет цепей,

Сбросим шоры мы и шпоры,

И забудем свист плетей.

Ждет нас сладкая свобода,

Мир прекрасней наших грез:

Покоренная природа,

Сено, клевер и овес.

Будет свекла кормовая,

Рис и теплая вода,

И людская воля злая

Нас оставит навсегда.

К цели будем мы стремиться,

Силы наши велики!

За работу, кони, птицы,

Свиньи, овцы и быки!

Все животные Британии

И других земель скоты,

Верьте мне, что день настанет

И исполнит все мечты!

Эта песня привела животных в дикое возбуждение. Майор еще не добрался до ее конца, а они уже подхватили песню сами. Даже самые глупые из них сразу же усвоили мотив и часть слов, а что касается самых разумных, таких, как свиньи и собаки, то они за несколько минут запомнили всю песню наизусть.

И после нескольких проб вся ферма в потрясающем единстве разразилась "Животными Британии". Коровы мычали эту песню, собаки ее выли, овцы блеяли ее, лошади ржали, утки крякали. Они были в таком восторге от песни, что спели ее пять раз кряду и пели бы еще всю ночь, если бы их не прервали.

Пение, к несчастью, разбудило мистера Джонса, который вскочил с кровати в полном убеждении, что во двор забралась лисица. Он схватил охотничье ружье, которое всегда стояло заряженным в углу его спальни, и выпалил в темноту картечью шестого калибра. Несколько картечин попало в стену гумна, и все скопище моментально распалось. Все разбежались по своим углам. Птицы взлетели на шестки, животные улеглись в солому, и очень скоро вся ферма погрузилась в сон.

Глава вторая

Три ночи спустя старый Майор мирно скончался. Он заснул и уже не проснулся. Его тело зарыли на окраине фруктового сада.

Это случилось в начале марта. В течение последующих трех месяцев на ферме шла бурная конспиративная деятельность. Речь Майора наиболее разумным животным фермы открыла совершенно новый взгляд на жизнь. Они не знали, когда начнется предсказанное Майором Восстание, у них не было никаких оснований полагать, что они до этого доживут, но они ясно осознали свой долг готовить Восстание.

Все бремя организации и обучения легло на плечи свиней, которые, по общему признанию, были самыми одаренными среди животных. Особенно выделялись два племенных кабана, Наполеон и Снежок, которых мистер Джонс выращивал на продажу. Наполеон, единственный на ферме хряк беркширской породы, был довольно свиреп на вид. Он не отличался красноречием, но все уважали его за умение настоять на своем.

Снежок был бойчей, изобретательней и гораздо острей на язык, но многие считали, что глубиной характера он уступал Наполеону.

Еще несколько холощеных кабанов мистер Джонс откармливал на убой. Из них наибольшей популярностью пользовался толстый маленький боров по кличке Визгун - с округлыми щечками, мигающими глазками, проворными движениями и пронзительным голоском. Это был блестящий оратор. Когда Визгун доказывал какой-нибудь особенно трудный тезис, он обыкновенно припрыгивал из стороны в сторону и подергивал хвостиком, что всегда как-то очень убеждало. О нем говаривали, что Визгун из черного может сделать белое.

Эти трое развили учение старого Майора в законченную систему воззрений, которую они назвали Зверизмом. Ночами, по нескольку раз в неделю, как только мистер Джонс засыпал, они устраивали тайные сборища на гумне, где излагали принципы Зверизма другим животным. Поначалу они столкнулись с определенным недомыслием или равнодушием. Некоторые животные напоминали о долге повиновения мистеру Джонсу, которого они называли "Хозяин", выдвигая примитивные доводы типа: "Мистер Джонс кормит нас. Если его не станет, мы передохнем с голоду". Другие спрашивали: "Зачем нам заботиться о том, что произойдет только после нашей смерти?" или "Если Восстание в любом случае неизбежно, то какая разница, будем мы его готовить или нет?", и нелегко было свиньям убедить их, что такие высказывания противоречат духу Зверизма. Самые глупые вопросы задавала белая кобылка Молли. Первое, что она спросила у Снежка, это будет ли после Восстания сахар.

- Нет, - твердо ответил Снежок, - мы не сможем сами производить у себя сахар. Да тебе и не нужен будет сахар. У тебя будет овса и сена, сколько ты захочешь.

- А можно мне будет вплетать в гриву ленточки? - спросила Молли.

- Товарищ зверь, - сказал Снежок, - эти твои любимые ленточки - не что иное, как символ рабства. Неужели ленточки тебе дороже свободы? Я уверен, что нет!

Молли согласилась, но ее согласие не выглядело особенно искренним.

Еще более тяжелую борьбу выдержали свиньи, разоблачая вредные выдумки ручного ворона Моисея. Любимчик мистера Джонса Моисей был, конечно, шпионом и сплетником, но зато врал он талантливо. Он утверждал, что после смерти все животные будто бы попадают в чудесную страну под названием Леденцовые Горы. Моисей уверял, что эти Леденцовые Горы находятся где-то высоко в небе, за облаками. Там семь воскресений на неделе, свежим клевером кормят зимой и летом, а колотый сахар и льняной жмых растут прямо на заборах. Животные недолюбливали Моисея за то, что он только болтает и не работает, но многие из них верили в Леденцовые Горы, и свиньям пришлось потратить немало усилий, доказывая, что такой страны не существует.

Наиболее верными учениками свиней оказались обе ломовые лошади, Боксер и Кашка. Они с огромным трудом могли бы что-нибудь придумать сами, но признав однажды свиней своими учителями, они принимали все, что те говорили, на веру и в доходчивых выражениях объясняли это другим животным. Они никогда не пропускали тайных сходок на гумне и первыми запевали "Всех животных Британии". Собрания всегда заканчивались пением этой песни.

Случилось так, что Восстание победило раньше и намного легче, чем предполагалось. Мистер Джонс хотя и был жестоким человеком, но в прежние годы хозяйствовал не так уж и плохо. Теперь же у него вдруг пошла полоса неудач. Началось с того, что он с большим убытком проиграл какую-то тяжбу, пал духом от этого и запил. Целыми днями он сидел на кухне, развалясь в виндзорском кресле, полистывал газеты, наливался спиртным и кормил Моисея размоченными в пиве хлебными корками. Его работники обленились и стали подворовывать, поля заросли бурьяном, крыши построек прохудились, живые изгороди пришли в полное запустение, а скотина была все время недокормлена.

Приближался июнь, и сено почти созрело для косьбы. В канун Иванова дня, который пришелся на субботу, мистер Джонс отправился в Виллингдон и там до того нарезался в "Рыжем Льве", что в воскресенье возвратился домой только к полудню. В отсутствие хозяина его работнички сразу после утренней дойки отправились охотиться на зайцев, даже и не подумав покормить скотину. Сам же мистер Джонс, вернувшись, тут же завалился на диван и заснул с газетой "Ньюс оф зе уорлд" на лице, так что и к вечеру животные остались голодными. Наконец терпение у них лопнуло. Одна из коров вышибла рогами двери амбара, и голодные животные набросились на мешки с зерном.

Как раз в это время мистер Джонс наконец продрал глаза. Уже через минуту он и четверо его людей ворвались в амбар с бичами и принялись хлестать всех, кто только попадался под руку. Этого животные уже не могли вынести. Хотя заранее они ни о чем подобном не сговаривались, тут они совсем озверели и в едином порыве набросились на своих мучителей. На Джонса и его людей со всех сторон посыпались удары рогов и копыт. Положение совсем вышло из-под контроля. Люди раньше никогда не видели, чтобы скотина вела себя таким образом, и их напугало и ошеломило внезапное возмущение тварей, которых они привыкли стегать бичами и вообще помыкать, как вздумается.

Пустив в ход сапоги, пару минут они еще пытались обороняться. Но еще через минуту все пятеро пустились в бегство по проселку, ведущему к главной дороге, а животные, торжествуя, преследовали их.

Когда миссис Джонс выглянула во двор из окна спальни и увидела, что там происходит, она поспешно покидала кое-какие пожитки в саквояж и выскользнула с фермы другой дорогой. Моисей снялся со своего шеста и, громко каркая, полетел за нею вслед. Между тем животные прогнали Джонса и его работников и захлопнули за ними обитые железными скрепами главные ворота фермы. Вот так, даже не осознав случившегося, животные свершили победоносное Восстание: Джонс был изгнан, а "Барская Ферма" перешла к ним. Первые минуты животные едва верили в свою удачу. Одержав победу, они сначала табуном промчались вдоль границ фермы, словно желая удостовериться, что от них не укрылось ни одно отродье рода человеческого. А потом они помчались назад в усадьбу, чтобы вымести последние следы ненавистной тирании Джонса.

Они взломали на конюшне дверь в кладовую, где хранилась упряжь, и утопили в колодце удила, кольца для ноздрей и собачьи цепи, изуверские ножи для кастрации поросят и ягнят. Поводья, уздечки, шоры, унизительные торбы они побросали в подожженную мусорную кучу во дворе. Туда же закинули и бичи, и когда они заполыхали, животные запрыгали от радости. Ленты, которые вплетали в лошадиные хвосты и гривы по праздничным дням, Снежок также бросил в огонь.

- Ленты, - сказал он, - следует рассматривать как одежду, каковая является отличительной чертой расы двуногих. Животные должны блюсти свою наготу.

Услышав это, Боксер сходил за маленькой соломенной шляпкой, которой он летом прикрывал от мух свои уши, и тоже предал еo огню.

После того, как они уничтожили эти напоминания о тирании Джонса, Наполеон повел их назад к амбару и выдал всем двойную норму зерна, а каждой собаке по два сухарика. Потом семь раз кряду спев "Всех животных Британии", они разошлись по своим своим местам и заснули так крепко, как не спали никогда.

На рассвете они проснулись как обычно и тут же, вспомнив, что произошло накануне, все вместе выбежали на пастбище. Здесь на лугу находился холм, с которого открывался вид на всю ферму. Животные взбежали на этот холм и огляделись кругом. Это были их владения - все, что они видели в ярком утреннем свете, принадлежало им! Придя от этой мысли в восторг, они носились по кругу, по кругу, возбужденно подпрыгивали, катались по росе, набивали рты сладкой летней травой, копытами взрывали черную землю и вдыхали ее благоухание.

Потом они устроили торжественный обход всей фермы и в немом восхищении обозрели пашни и луга, сад, пруд и рощу. Они как будто впервые видели все это, и даже сейчас им с трудом верилось, что теперь все это принадлежит им, животным.

Вернувшись в усадьбу, они молча остановились у дверей господского дома. Дом теперь тоже принадлежал им, но внутрь входить все равно было как-то страшновато. Через минуту, однако, Снежок и Наполеон разом толкнули двери, распахнувшиеся от этого настежь, и животные гуськом вошли в дом, ступая с величайшей осторожностью из опасения перевернуть что-нибудь. Они переходили из комнаты в комнату на цыпочках, боясь выговорить слово даже шепотом и с каким-то благоговейным ужасом глядя на невероятную роскошь: на кровати с пуховыми перинами, на зеркала, на диван, набитый конским волосом, на брюссельский ковер и литографию с изображением королевы Виктории, стоявшую на камине в гостиной.

Когда, спускаясь по ступенькам, они выходили из дома, кто-то вдруг хватился, что с ними нет Молли. Пришлось вернуться назад. Оказалось, что Молли отстала от всех и застряла в самой роскошной спальне. Взяв кусок голубой ленты с туалетного столика миссис Джонс, Молли примеряла его себе через плечо, любуясь своим отражением в зеркале с самым глупейшим видом. Ее жестоко выругали и покинули дом.

Несколько свиных окороков, висевших на кухне, взяли с собой для погребения, да еще Боксер проломил ударом копыта пивной бочонок в буфетной больше в доме ничего не тронули. Тут же на месте они приняли единодушное решение сохранить дом как музей. Ни у кого и мысли не возникло, что кто-нибудь из них захочет тут поселиться.

После завтрака Снежок и Наполеон вновь собрали всех животных.

- Товарищи звери! - сказал Снежок. - Сейчас половина седьмого, и впереди у нас долгий день. Сегодня мы начнем сенокос. Но сначала нам предстоит еще одно неотложное дело.

Свиньи открылись, что за последние три месяца они выучились читать и писать - по найденному ими на помойке старому букварю, когда-то принадлежавшему детям мистера Джонса. Наполеон послал за ведрами с черной и белой краской и повел всех вниз, к выходившим на главную дорогу воротам, которые были окованы пятью железными скрепами. Там Снежок, у которого был самый лучший почерк, замазал кистью слова "Барская Ферма" на верхней железной планке и вместо этого вывел: "Зверская Ферма". Именно так она должна была теперь называться. После этого они возвратились в усадьбу, где Снежок и Наполеон послали за стремянкой, велев приставить ее к торцовой стенке большого гумна. Они объяснили, что трехмесячными усилиями свиней принципы Зверизма сведены ныне к Семи Заповедям. Эти СЕМЬ ЗАПОВЕДЕЙ будут теперь начертаны на стене. Они образуют нерушимый закон, по которому отныне и навеки будут жить все звери фермы. Не без труда (потому что свинье нелегко удержать равновесие на ступеньках лестницы) Снежок взобрался наверх и принялся за работу, а Визгун несколькими ступеньками ниже держал ведро с краской. Заповеди были выведены большими белыми буквами на просмоленной стене, и каждый мог прочесть эти буквы с тридцати ярдов. Они гласили:

СЕМЬ ЗАПОВЕДЕЙ

1. Всякое двуногое существо - ВРАГ.

2. Всякое четвероногое или пернатое существо - ДРУГ.

3. Зверь не носит одежду.

4. Зверь не спит в кровати.

5. Зверь не пьет спиртное.

6. Да не убьет зверь другого зверя.

7. Все звери равны.

Все это было выведено очень красиво и, не считая того, что вместо "друг" на самом деле получилось "дург", да еще буква "с" смотрела в одном месте не в ту сторону, все остальное было написано совершенно правильно. Снежок огласил текст Заповедей. Все согласно закивали, а самые умные из животных тут же принялись заучивать заповеди наизусть.

- А теперь, товарищи, - сказал Снежок, отбросив кисть, - на сенокос! Уберем сено быстрее, чем работники Джонса, пусть это будет делом нашей чести!

В эту минуту все три коровы, которые давно переминались с ноги на ногу, громко замычали. Бедняг не доили уже целые сутки, и они просто лопались от переполнявшего их молока. После недолгих размышлений свиньи послали за подойниками и справились с делом довольно успешно - раздвоенные копытца свиней, как оказалось, были вполне приспособлены для этой задачи. После дойки набралось целых пять ведер пенящегося жирного молока, на которое многие из животных смотрели с неподдельным интересом.

- Что мы с ним сделаем? - спросил кто-то.

- Джонс иногда добавлял немного молока в наше пойло - прокудахтала какая-то курица.

- Не думайте об этом, товарищи, - воскликнул Наполеон, заслонив молочные ведра собою. - О молоке позаботятся. Сенокос сейчас важнее всего. Товарищ Снежок поведет вас. Я присоединюсь к вам через несколько минут. Вперед, товарищи! Дело не ждет!

И животные строем зашагали на работу. Вернувшись вечером, они заметили, что молоко куда-то исчезло.

Глава третья

Как они работали и сколько пота пролили на этом сенокосе! Но труды их не пропали даром, потому что результат уборки превзошел все их ожидания.

Работалось иногда очень трудно: все инструменты были приспособлены под людей, а не под животных, и главным препятствием было то, что ни одно из животных не могло справиться с орудиями, применение которых требовало хождения на двух ногах. Свиньи, однако, проявляли чудеса изобретательности и так или иначе находили выход из любого положения. Что же касается лошадей, то они прекрасно знали каждую пядь земли, а в косьбе и скирдовании понимали едва ли не больше, чем Джонс и его работники.

Само собой сложилось, что свиньи не принимали непосредственного участия в работах, а только руководили и надзирали за остальными - благодаря превосходству в знаниях обязанность руководить легла на них самым естественным образом. Боксер и Кашка сами впрягались в сенокосилку или большие ворошильные грабли на конной тяге (разумеется, без всяких удил и поводьев) и ходили размеренно кругами по лугу, а свинья шла сзади и по мере необходимости отдавала команды: "Но-о, товарищ зверь! Пошел!" или "Тпру, товарищ зверь! Тпру!". В ворошении и уборке скошенного сена приняли участие все животные, даже самые мелкие. Даже утки и куры, невзирая на жару, трудились весь день, перенося крохотные пучки травы в своих клювиках.

В итоге они разделались с сенокосом на два дня раньше, чем в прошлом году работники Джонса. Уборку удалось провести совершенно без потерь, зоркие куры и утки подобрали все до последнего стебелька. И ни одно животное не украло ни травинки.

Все лето дела на ферме шли как по маслу. Животные никогда в жизни даже и не подозревали, что могут чувствовать себя такими счастливыми. Каждый глоток еды доставлял им самое острое наслаждение, потому что это теперь и вправду была ИХ пища, которую они сами производили для себя, а не подачка жадного хозяина. Теперь, когда никчемные двуногие паразиты исчезли, даже несмотря на всю неопытность животных и еды и свободного времени у них было больше. Их ожидали многочисленные непредвиденные трудности: например, в самом конце сезона, во время уборки хлеба, пришлось вместо молотьбы дедовским способом вытаптывать зерна из колосьев, а провеивать зерно - силой собственного дыхания, потому что ни молотилки, ни веялки на ферме не было. Но сообразительность свиней и мощная мускулатура Боксера помогали выпутываться из всех затруднений.

Непомерные силы Боксера были предметом всеобщего восхищения. И во времена Джонса он был усердным работягой, теперь же он просто вкалывал за троих. Бывали дни, когда казалось, что все на ферме держится на его могучих плечах. С утра до ночи он таскал или подталкивал, всегда находясь там, где труднее. Он договорился с петухом, чтобы тот будил его по утрам на полчаса раньше всех остальных, и до начала дневных работ один добровольно трудился там, где, по его мнению, это было всего нужнее. В ответ на любое затруднение, на любую неудачу он говорил: "Я буду работать еще упорней!" Эти слова стали его девизом.

Но и все остальные старались в меру своих сил. Куры и утки, например, подбирая упавшие колоски, сберегли зерна на целых пять бушелей. Никто не воровал, никто не жаловался на еду, а ссоры, взаимные щепки и зависть, которые в прежние времена были повседневным явлением, теперь почти исчезли. Никто не ленился - или почти никто. Молли, правда, не очень хорошо поднималась по утрам и имела обыкновение уходить с работы пораньше под предлогом мозолей на копытах. Странновато выглядело поведение кошки. Очень скоро все заметили, что ее обычно невозможно найти перед началом работ, она пропадала где-то часами - а потом, как ни в чем не бывало, приходила к обеду или вечером после окончания рабочего дня. Но у нее всегда были такие исключительные уважительные причины и мурлыкала она так проникновенно, что усомниться в ее добрых намерениях было невозможно.

Старый осел Бенджамин, казалось, нисколько не изменился после Восстания. Он выполнял свою работу с той же неторопливой тщательностью, как при Джонсе, ни от каких заданий не увиливал, но и не надрывался на добровольных сверхурочных. О Восстании и его последствиях он своего мнения не высказывал. Когда его прямо спрашивали, чувствует ли он себя счастливей после изгнания Джонса, он обыкновенно произносил что-нибудь вроде:

- Ослы живут долго. Никто из вас еще не видел дохлого осла.

Приходилось довольствоваться этим туманным ответом.

По воскресеньям не работали. Завтракали на час позже, чем обычно, а после завтрака происходила церемония, которая неукоснительно соблюдалась каждую неделю. Сначала поднимали флаг. Снежку попалась в подсобке для инструментов старая зеленая скатерть миссис Джонс, на которой он белой краской намалевал рог и копыта. Каждое воскресное утро поднимали теперь эту скатерть на флагштоке бывшего жилого дома. "Зеленый цвет нашего знамени, объяснял Снежок, - обозначает луга и пастбища Англии, а копыто и рог символизируют грядущую Республику Зверей, которую мы создадим после полной и окончательной победой над родом человеческим".

После подъема флага все животные собирались на большом гумне на общее собрание или Совет. Здесь намечались работы на предстоящую неделю и велось обсуждение предлагаемых постановлений. Авторами и инициаторами всех постановлений Совета всегда были свиньи. Другие животные скоро усвоили сам обычай голосования, но самостоятельно выдвигать предложения так и не научились.

Активнее всех в обсуждении проектов постановлений участвовали оба хряка - Снежок и Наполеон. Было, однако, замечено, что эта парочка никогда ни в чем не бывает согласна. Что бы ни предлагал один из них, другой непременно был против. Даже когда возникала идея - сама по себе не вызывавшая разногласий - небольшой лужок за садом отвести под пастбище для тех животных, которые по старости утратят трудоспособность, Снежок и Наполеон сцепились по вопросу о пенсионном возрасте для каждой породы животных.

Совет всегда заканчивался пением "Всех животных Британии". Послеобеденное время отводилось для воскресных развлечений.

Свиньи превратили подсобку, где раньше хранились инструменты и упряжь, в свою штаб-квартиру. По книгам, вынесенным из дома, они вечерами изучали здесь кузнечное дело, плотницкое искусство и другие необходимые ремесла. Снежок, кроме этого, занялся созданием "животкомов", или Животных Комитетов. В этом ему не было равных. Он организовал Комитет по Производству Яиц для кур и Лигу Чистых Хвостов для коров, Комитет Перековки Диких Товарищей (с целью перевоспитания крыс и зайцев), Движение за Самую Белую Шерсть для овец и многое другое - помимо обучения чтению и письму.

В своем большинстве эти затеи потерпели крах. Попытка приручить диких животных провалилась почти с самого начала. Они продолжали жить по-старому, а когда к ним проявляли великодушие, просто старались извлечь из этого максимальные выгоды. В Животком Перековки вошла кошка и в течение нескольких первых дней работала в нем очень активно. Однажды ее видели сидящей на крыше, где она проводила воспитательную беседу с воробьями, которые, впрочем, были вне пределов ее досягаемости. Она говорила им, что все звери теперь - товарищи и что любой воробей может, если захочет, подлететь и посидеть у нее на лапке. Воробьи, однако, держались от нее подальше.

Занятия чтением и письмом, впрочем, пользовались большим успехом. К осени каждое животное на ферме в той или иной степени повысило свой образовательный уровень. Что касается свиней, то они давно овладели грамотой в совершенстве. Сравнительно неплохо выучились читать собаки, но, если не считать Семи Заповедей, чтение их мало интересовало. Коза Мюриель превзошла в чтении даже собак и иногда по вечерам, бывало, зачитывала для окружающих обрывки газетных статей, которые ей попадались на помойке. Бенджамин читал не хуже любой свиньи, но своих способностей особо не применял. "Насколько я знаю, - говорил он, - на свете нет ничего такого, что действительно стоит прочтения". Кашка выучила весь алфавит, но слова складывать не умела. Боксеру не удалось пойти дальше буквы "Г". Он своим огромным копытом выводил в пыли буквы "А, Б, В, Г", а потом стоял и вглядывался, сдвинув уши назад, потряхивая временами гривой и стараясь изо всех сил припомнить, что там дальше, и всегда безуспешно. Иногда, правда, он брался учить "Д, Е, Ж, З", но к тому моменту, когда он осваивал их, оказывалось, что буквы "А, Б, В, Г" начисто улетучились из его памяти. Наконец, он решил удовлетвориться четырьмя первыми буквами алфавита и обыкновенно писал их дважды или трижды на дню, чтобы освежить их в памяти. Молли отказалась учить что-либо еще кроме литер, из которых складывалось ее имя. Она очень искусно выкладывала их из прутиков, украшала парой-другой цветочков и разгуливала вокруг, не сводя с них восхищенного взора.

Все остальные не продвинулись дальше буквы "A". Кроме того, выяснилось, что самые неспособные животные, например овцы, куры и утки, не в силах запомнить наизусть даже Семь Заповедей. После некоторого размышления Снежок объявил, что Семь Заповедей можно на деле свести к единственному принципу, а именно: "Четыре ноги - хорошо, две ноги - плохо". "Этот принцип, - сказал он, - вполне выражает сущность Зверизма. Всякий, кто его прочно усвоил, застрахован от человеческого влияния". Птицы поначалу возражали, потому что им показалось, будто у них тоже две ноги, но Снежок с легкостью переубедил их.

- Птичье крыло, товарищи звери, - сказал он, - не есть орган действия или преступного бездействия. Крыло - орган ПЕРЕДВИЖЕНИЯ, то есть НОГА. Отличительный признак человека - это РУКА, орудие его бесчисленных злодеяний.

Птицы не поняли длинных слов, которые употребил Снежок, но приняли его объяснение на веру. Животные не слишком одаренные все до единого стали заучивать новый афоризм наизусть. Слова ЧЕТЫРЕ - ХОРОШО, ДВЕ - ПЛОХО начертали на торцовой стенке гумна выше Семи Заповедей и более крупными буквами. Выучив это правило наизусть, овцы очень полюбили его. Лежа на лугу, они часто начинали блеять хором: "Четыре - хорошо, две - плохо, четыре хорошо, две - плохо..." и могли твердить это часами, нисколько не уставая.

Наполеон к комитетам Снежка не проявлял видимого интереса. Он говорил, что забота о подрастающем поколении гораздо важнее и перспективнее всего, что можно сделать для взрослых. Джесси и Блюбель ощенились сразу после сенокоса, родив в общей сложности девятерых щенят. Как только щенки смогли обходиться без материнского молока, Наполеон забрал их, сказав, что сам займется их воспитанием. Он поселил щенков на сеновале, куда можно было попасть только по приставной лестнице из подсобки для инструментов, и держал их там в таком уединении, что на ферме скоро забыли об их существовании.

Тайна исчезновения молока раскрылась быстро. Это молоко каждый день замешивали теперь в свиное пойло. Подоспели ранние сорта яблок, и сад завалило падалицей. Сначала животные считали самим собою разумеющимся, что эти яблоки следует разделить поровну между всеми, но тут последовал приказ снести их в подсобку - в распоряжение свиней. Тут некоторые из животных было возроптали, но без толку. У свиней было полное единодушие по этому вопросу даже у Снежка с Наполеоном. Миссия разъяснить необходимость такого решения была возложена на Визгуна.

- Товарищи звери! - хрюкал Визгун. - Вы, надеюсь, не думаете, что мы, свиньи - просто эгоисты, ищем для себя привилегий - и потому пьем молоко и лопаем яблоки? Если хотите знать, многие из нас не любят ни молока, ни яблок. Я сам, например, их терпеть не могу! Единственная цель, которую преследует данное решение, - это поддержать наше здоровье. Молоко и яблоки (и это научно доказанный факт, товарищи!) содержат вещества, совершенно необходимые для здоровья свиней. Мы, свиньи, - животные умственного труда, мы - руководящая и направляющая сила этой фермы. День и ночь мы заботимся о всеобщем благосостоянии. Это ради ВАС мы пьем это молоко и давимся яблоками! Знаете ли вы, что будет, если мы, свиньи, не сможем больше справляться со своими обязанностями? Джонс вернется! Да-да, Джонс вернется! Неужели, товарищи, - вопил Визгун почти умоляюще, прыгая во все стороны и размахивая хвостиком, - неужели кто-нибудь из вас хочет снова увидеть Джонса?

Уж если и было что-то на свете, в чем животные были уверены, так это в том, что они не желают возвращения Джонса. Как только вопрос о яблоках предстал перед ними в этом свете, им уже было нечего возразить. Важность поддержания свиней в добром здравии была очевидной. Без дальнейших споров было решено, что молоко и попадавшие яблоки (а заодно и основной урожай яблок, как только они созреют) пойдут только на свиней.

Глава четвертая

К концу лета слухи о том, что происходит на Зверской Ферме, облетели всю округу. Каждый день Снежок и Наполеон снаряжали стаи голубей, давая им одно и то же задание: заводить связи с домашней скотиной на других фермах, рассказывать им историю Восстания и обучать их пению "Всех животных Британии".

Почти все это время мистер Джонс провел в пивном баре "Рыжий Лев" в Виллингдоне, жалуясь всем, у кого была охота его слушать, на постигшую его великую несправедливость, на подлых, ничтожных скотов, осмелившихся посягнуть на священное право частной собственности. Другие фермеры в общем сочувствовали ему, но на первых порах никакой особенной помощи не оказали. Каждый из них в душе надеялся извлечь из неприятностей Джонса какую-нибудь пользу для себя.

К счастью для животных, владельцы двух ближайших соседних ферм на дух не выносили друг друга. Земли обширной, но запущенной фермы Фоксвуд сильно заросли кустарником, хозяйство там велось по старинке, пастбища были истощены, а живые изгороди находились в безобразном состоянии. Владелец Фоксвуда мистер Пилькингтон, джентльмен и человек легкомысленный, большую часть своего времени проводил, смотря по сезону, на рыбалке или охоте. Ферма Пинчфильд была поменьше, но содержалась лучше. Владелец ее мистер Фредерик, упрямый и желчный человек, постоянно был занят тяжбами с соседями и слыл большим скупердяем. Мистер Пилькингтон и мистер Фредерик до того не терпели друг друга, что даже во имя защиты своих собственных интересов вряд ли бы смогли о чем-нибудь договориться.

Тем не менее, их обоих не на шутку напугало восстание на Барской Ферме, и они были сильно озабочены тем, как предотвратить распространение слишком подробных сведений о нем среди своих животных. Сначала они делали вид, будто их смешит сама мысль о домашней скотине, самостоятельно управляющей на ферме. "Все это кончится в течение двух недель", - говорили они. Они распускали слухи, будто животные на Барской Ферме (они не выносили названия "Зверская Ферма" и упорно продолжали именовать ее по-старому) все время грызутся друг с другом и дохнут от голода. Когда прошло время, а животные от голода явно не вымерли, Фредерик и Пилькингтон сменили пластинку и стали твердить об ужасных пороках, царящих на ферме. Они утверждали, что животные там практикуют каннибализм, пытают друг друга раскаленными докрасна подковами и ввели общность самок. "Вот к чему приводит восстание против законов Природы", - говорили Фредерик и Пилькингтон.

Тем не менее, в полной мере никто этим россказням не верил. Слухи о ферме чудес, откуда изгнали двуногих и где животные управляют собой сами, продолжали циркулировать в смутном и искаженном виде, и в течение года по всей стране прокатилась волна неповиновения. Быки, которые раньше всегда вели себя дисциплинированно, вдруг превращались в бешеных диких зверей, овцы ломали изгороди и объедали посевы клевера, коровы опрокидывали подойники, верховые лошади вместо того, чтобы брать препятствие, перебрасывали через него седока.

А кроме того, мелодия и даже слова "Всех животных Британии" стали известны повсюду. Они распространялись с поразительной быстротой. Двуногие не могли скрывать своей ярости, когда слышали эту песню, хотя и делали вид, что она им кажется просто нелепой. Они говорили, что не могут себе представить, как это, даже будучи безмозглой скотиной, можно петь такую галиматью. Но любое животное, которое они заставали за пением, люди бичевали до полусмерти. И все-таки с песней нельзя было справиться. Черные дрозды высвистывали ее из кустов живой изгороди, голуби нашептывали ее с вязов, она перебивала громыхание кузниц и звоны церковных колоколов. И когда люди слышали ее, они втайне трепетали, чувствуя в ней предвестие своей будущей гибели.

В начале октября, когда урожай был снят, сложен в стога и частично обмолочен, стайка голубей, сделав круг в воздухе, в дичайшем возбуждении опустилась во дворе Зверской Фермы. Как оказалось, Джонс со своими работниками и полудюжиной добровольцев из Фоксвуда и Пинчфильда вторгся на территорию фермы через главные ворота, окованные пятью железными скрепами, и направляется вверх по проселку, ведущему к усадьбе. Вооружены они были палками, а Джонс шествовал впереди всех с охотничьим ружьем в руках. Намерения людей были очевидны: они явно собирались отбить ферму.

Этого давно ожидали, и все необходимые приготовления были сделаны заранее. Оборону фермы возглавил Снежок, который изучил найденную в доме старую книгу о походах Юлия Цезаря. Он быстро отдал нужные приказания, и уже через пару минут каждое животное заняло свое заранее назначенное место.

Первую атаку Снежок предпринял, как только люди приблизились к усадьбе. Все 35 голубей взлетели разом и закружились над головами захватчиков, забрасывая их липким пометом, а пока внимание людей было отвлечено к небу, вперед выскочили спрятанные за оградой гуси и стали злодейским образом клевать их за икры. Это была как бы небольшая разведка боем с целью внести в ряды противника легкое замешательство. Люди легко отбились от гусей палками.

Но тут Снежок задействовал вторую линию обороны. Возглавленное самим Снежком стадо овец и баранов, а с ними Мюриель и Бенджамин, - лавиной ринулось на людей. Звери кололи своих врагов рогами, толкали их со всех сторон, а Бенджамин, развернувшись задом, лупил их своими крохотными копытцами. И опять люди легко отбились палками и коваными сапогами, и тогда, по пронзительному визгу, который был условным сигналом к отходу на заранее подготовленные позиции, все животные разом повернули назад и через открытые ворота убежали на скотный двор.

У людей вырвался крик торжества. Они увидели - так им показалось паническое бегство животных и ринулись за ними вслед безо всякого порядка. Именно этого и добивался Снежок. Как только люди достаточно углубились во двор, три лошади, три коровы и все свиньи, которые укрывшись в коровнике, залегли в засаде, внезапно возникли у них в тылу, отрезав путь к отступлению.

Снежок дал сигнал к атаке, а сам бросился прямо на Джонса. Увидев это, фермер поднял ружье и выстрелил. Дробь прочертила глубокие кровавые раны на спине Снежка, а одна овца была застрелена насмерть. Ни на секунду не останавливаясь, Снежок налетел на фермера и все шесть пудов своего веса бросил ему под ноги. Джонс опрокинулся в навозную кучу, и ружье вывалилось из его рук.

Но особенно устрашающее впечатление на захватчиков произвел Боксер. Он вставал на дыбы и бил своими огромными, подбитыми железом копытами как бешеный. Первый же его удар настиг мальчишку-конюха из Фоксвуда, который получил по лбу копытом и распростерся в грязи, не подавая признаков жизни. При виде этого несколько человек отшвырнули свои дубины и обратились в бегство.

Двуногих охватила паника, и уже в следующую минуту животные гонялись за ними по всему двору. Их кололи рогами, били копытами, кусали и топтали. Не было такого животного на ферме, которое бы, как умело, не свело бы с ними своих счетов. Даже кошка неожиданно спрыгнула с крыши на плечи пастуха и запустила ему в горло свои когти, от чего тот в ужасе завопил. В ту минуту, когда ворота вдруг оказались свободными, люди уже были рады возможности вырваться за пределы двора и удрать по главной дороге. Уже через пять минут после вторжения во двор двуногие постыдно убегали тем же путем, которым пришли, а следом за ними, громко шипя, бежали гуси и щипали их за икры.

Все люди, за исключением одного, покинули ферму. Вернувшийся во двор Боксер потрогал копытом конюха, который ничком лежал в грязи, и попытался перевернуть его. Парень не шевельнулся.

- Он умер, - сказал Боксер печально. - Я не хотел этого. Я забыл про свои подковы. Я, - правда, - сделал это не нарочно!

- Ни к чему эти сантименты, товарищ! - воскликнул Снежок. Из ран Снежка сочилась кровь. - На войне как на войне. Только мертвый двуногий - хороший двуногий.

- Я никого не хотел убивать, даже двуногих, - повторял Боксер, и глаза его были полны слез.

- А где Молли? - воскликнул кто-то.

И действительно, Молли пропала. На минуту возник великий переполох, так как все за нее испугались. Что с нею сделали люди - может быть, увели в плен? В конце концов, однако, Молли удалось отыскать в ее собственном стойле, где она лежала, ничего не видя и не слыша, спрятав голову под сеном в яслях. Она сбежала с поля боя, как только раздался выстрел. А когда, посмотрев на нее, все вернулись во двор, оказалось, что мальчишка-конюх, которого Боксер вовсе не убил, а только оглушил, сбежал из усадьбы.

Все еще не остыв, животные вновь собрались все вместе, шумно делясь рассказами о своих ратных подвигах. Тотчас же было устроено импровизированное празднество. Был поднят флаг, несколько раз спели "Животных Британии" и предали торжественному погребению погибшую смертью храбрых овцу. На ее могиле высадили куст боярышника. Снежок произнес небольшую надгробную речь, упирая в своем выступлении на необходимость если понадобится - всем погибнуть в бою за Зверскую Ферму.

Единодушно было решено учредить боевой орден "Зверь-Герой" первой степени, которым тут же наградили Снежка и Боксера. Этот орден представлял собой медный жетон (а в подсобке обнаружилось несколько таких медных блях) для ношения по праздникам и воскресным дням. Было учреждено и звание "Зверь-Герой" второй степени, которое посмертно присвоили погибшей овце.

Долго спорили о том, как будет называться выигранное сражение. В конце концов назвали его "Битвой при Коровнике", поскольку именно в коровнике была устроена засада, решившая исход битвы. В грязи отыскалось охотничье ружье мистера Джонса, а в доме обнаружили и запас патронов. Ружье решили установить у подножия флагштока в качестве артиллерийского орудия и отныне палить из него дважды в год: 12 октября, в годовщину Битвы при Коровнике, и 24 июня, в годовщину Восстания.

Глава пятая

С началом зимы поведение Молли стало вызывать все большее и большее беспокойство. Каждое утро она опаздывала на работу, оправдываясь тем, что якобы проспала. Жаловалась на непонятные боли, хотя аппетит у нее оставался превосходным. Она стремилась прогулять работу под любым предлогом и пойти вместо этого к пруду с питьевой водой, где она обычно подолгу с глупейшим видом пялилась на свое отражение в воде. Но поговаривали о вещах и более серьезных.

Однажды, когда Молли весело вбежала во двор, размахивая своим длинным хвостом и пожевывая стебелек травы, Кашка отвела ее в сторону.

- Молли, - сказала она, - мне нужно серьезно поговорить с тобой. Сегодня утром я видела, как ты заглядывала через изгородь, которая отделяет Зверскую Ферму от Фоксвуда. За изгородью стоял кто-то из работников мистера Пилькингтона. Я почти уверена, хотя и была далеко, что он что-то сказал тебе и даже гладил тебя! Что все это значит, Молли?

- Нет! Не было этого! Это все неправда! - заржала Молли, вскидываясь на дыбы и колотя по земле копытами.

- Посмотри мне в глаза, Молли! Дай мне честное слово, что он тебя не гладил!

- Это неправда, - твердила Молли, но не смогла посмотреть Кашке в глаза, а еще через минуту сорвалась с места и умчалась на пастбище.

Неожиданная догадка сразила Кашку. Не говоря никому ни слова, она пошла в стойло Молли и копытом разрыла там солому. Под соломой было запрятано несколько пучков разноцветных лент и маленькая кучка пиленого сахара.

Через три дня Молли исчезла. Несколько недель никто ничего не знал о месте ее пребывания, но потом голуби донесли, что ее видели на другом конце Виллингдона. Она стояла возле трактира, запряженная в нарядный, раскрашенный в красно-черные цвета экипаж. Жирный красномордый человек в клетчатых бриджах и гетрах, похожий на трактирщика, поглаживал ей морду и кормил сахаром. В ее подстриженную челку была вплетена алая ленточка. Похоже, что она была очень довольна собой, сказали голуби. Никто из животных больше никогда не упоминал ее имени.

Январь выдался очень суровый. Земля звенела от мороза как сталь и на полях делать было нечего. Совет на большом гумне собирался чаще, чем обычно. Свиньи занялись планированием работ на следующий сельскохозяйственный сезон. Все уже принимали как должное, что свиньи, как самые смышленые на ферме, разрабатывают все вопросы хозяйственной политики, хотя решения их обязательно утверждаются большинством голосов на Совете. Этот порядок в общем полностью оправдывал бы себя, если бы не раздоры между Снежком и Наполеоном. Они не могли прийти к согласию ни по одному вопросу. Если один из них предлагал как можно больше земли отводить под ячмень, то другой непременно требовал сажать главным образом овес, и если один говорил, что такие-то и такие-то поля очень хороши под капусту, то другой сразу же начинал утверждать, что они годятся только под корнеплоды. У каждого были свои сторонники, и Совет становился ареной нескончаемых споров.

Блистательные выступления с трибуны часто приносили Снежку большинство на Совете, но Наполеон отыгрывался в промежутках между Советами, успешно склоняя животных на свою сторону. Особенно большой популярностью он пользовался среди овец. В последнее время они принимались блеять "Четыре хорошо, два - плохо" к месту и не к месту, из-за чего Советы даже приходилось прерывать. Нетрудно было заметить, что особенно часто они вспоминали об этом лозунге в наиболее ответственные моменты выступлений Снежка.

Снежок обнаружил в доме несколько старых номеров журнала "Земледелец и животновод", тщательно изучил их и преисполнился стремлением ко всякого рода нововведениям и преобразованиям. Он учено толковал о дренажных канавах, силосе и зольных удобрениях и с целью повышения плодородия полей выработал для каждого животного сложный план непосредственного внесения навоза в почву, чтобы не тратить усилий на его перевозку, причем каждый день следовало удобрять новый заранее определенный участок. Наполеон собственных планов не разрабатывал, но уверенно говорил, что прожекты Снежка гроша ломаного не стоят, и, казалось, чего-то выжидал. Самая ожесточенная дискуссия разразилась у них по поводу ветряной мельницы.

На обширном выгоне неподалеку от усадьбы возвышался небольшая холм самое высокое место на территории фермы. Изучив состав почв, Снежок объявил, что именно здесь следует построить ветряную мельницу, которая приведет в движение динамо-машину и снабдит всю ферму электроэнергией. Эта мельница, по словам Снежка, осветит и отопит зимой все сараи и стойла, будет приводить в действие циркулярную пилу, соломорезку, свеклорезку и электродоилку. Животные никогда в жизни не слышали таких слов. Ферму мистера Джонса справедливо считали отсталой, механизация на ней была в самом зачаточном состоянии. Животные слушали Снежка с изумлением, а он вызывал в их воображении вереницы фантастических машин, которые будут выполнять тяжелые работы, в то время как сами они будут пастись в свое удовольствие на полях, либо совершенствовать свои познания чтением книг или беседами.

Подробные чертежи мельницы Снежок разработал за несколько недель. Конструкции металлических деталей были заимствованы главным образом из трех книг, принадлежавших ранее мистеру Джонсу: "Тысяча полезных дел для дома", "Каждый сам себе каменщик" и "Электричество для начинающих". В качестве кабинета для своих занятий Снежок избрал сарай, в котором раньше стоял инкубатор, где был гладкий деревянный пол, очень удобный для черчения. Там он торчал целыми днями. Чтобы книги не закрывались, Снежок укладывал камни на страницах, а сам, зажав ножкой кусок мела, бегал по сараю взад и вперед, чертя линию за линией и слегка повизгивая от возбуждения. Постепенно эти линии превратились в сложное нагромождение кривошипов и зубчатых валов, и покрыли больше половины пола. Остальные животные находили, что хотя это и непонятно, но впечатляет. По меньшей мере раз в неделю они являлись взглянуть на рисунки Снежка. Заглядывали даже утки и куры, изо всех сил стараясь не наступить на проведенные мелом линии.

Один Наполеон оставался равнодушным. Он объявил себя противником мельницы с самого начала. Правда, однажды и он вдруг пришел ознакомиться с трудами Снежка. С важным видом Наполеон обошел весь сарай, внимательно осмотрел все детали чертежей и рисунков, понюхал их раз или два, немного постоял, скосив глаза и как бы охватывая чертежи в целом, а потом приподнял ножку, помочился на чертежи и вышел, не проронив ни слова.

Вопрос о мельнице глубоко расколол всю ферму. Снежок не скрывал, что построить ее будет совсем не просто. Предстояло добыть камень из карьера, возвести стены, сделать крылья. Нужно будет, кроме того, где-то добыть динамо-машину и кабель. Снежок не говорил, откуда все это возьмется, но утверждал, что построить мельницу можно будет за год. А после этого, заявлял он, - мельница позволит нам экономить столько труда, что мы будем работать всего три дня в неделю.

Наполеон, со своей стороны, настаивал, что важнейшая задача текущего момента - это выполнение продовольственной программы и что если они будут тратить время на мельницу вместо увеличения производства продуктов питания, то все они просто вымрут от голода. Все животные поделились на две фракции: одна выступала под лозунгом "За Снежка и трехдневную рабочую неделю!", другая - "За Наполеона и полную кормушку!".

Только Бенджамин не примкнул ни к той, ни к другой фракции. Он не верил ни в продовольственное изобилие, ни в трехдневную рабочую неделю. "С мельницей или без мельницы, а жить будем как жили, то есть хреновато", говорил он.

Почти столько же споров вызывали вопросы обороны. Все прекрасно понимали, что хотя двуногих и разбили в Битве при Коровнике, они не оставили своих намерений и от них следует ждать другой, более решительной попытки отвоевать ферму и восстановить власть мистера Джонса, тем более что весть об этом поражении людей распространилась по всей округе, будоражила домашнюю скотину и вселяла в нее непокорность.

Как обычно, Снежок и Наполеон никак не могли сойтись во взглядах. Согласно Наполеону, животным следовало запасать огнестрельное оружие и учиться его применению на практике. Согласно Снежку, они должны были снаряжать как можно больше голубей для революционной агитации на других фермах. Один настаивал, что если они не научатся защищать себя, их завоюют, другой же утверждал, что если Восстание победит повсеместно, то необходимость обороняться отпадет сама собой. Сначала животные выслушивали Наполеона, потом Снежка и никак не могли понять, кто же все-таки прав. Сказать по правде, они обычно соглашались с тем из них, кто в данный момент хрюкал речь.

Наконец, наступил день, когда Снежок дорисовал свои чертежи, и на ближайшем воскресном Совете вопрос о строительстве мельницы был поставлен на голосование. Когда все собрались на большом гумне, Снежок встал и, хотя овечье блеянье то и дело прерывало его рассуждения, прохрюкал свои доводы в пользу строительства ветряной мельницы.

Потом вышел Наполеон. Сохраняя полное спокойствие, он хрюкнул, что мельница - это просто бред, он голосовать за нее никому не советует, и снова сел. Его выступление длилось едва ли тридцать секунд, и, можно было подумать, что результат ему совершенно безразличен.

Тут Снежок вновь вскочил с места и, резким окриком утихомирив овец, которые было опять разблеялись, разразился пламенной тирадой в защиту мельницы. До сих пор животные почти поровну делились в своих симпатиях, но красноречие Снежка в эту минуту увлекло почти всех. Он яркими красками описал, во что превратится Зверская Ферма, когда животные освободятся от черной работы.

- Электричество, - кричал он, - приведет в движение молотилки, плуги, бороны, косилки, жатвенные машины с сноповязалками, не говоря уж о том, что в каждом стойле, каждом хлеву, каждом коровнике и каждом птичнике будет свое собственное электрическое освещение, отопление, а также холодная и горячая вода!

Когда он закончил, исход предстоящего голосования не вызывал никаких сомнений. Но как раз в эту минуту Наполеон вскочил и, бросив косой взгляд на Снежка, вдруг взвизгнул каким-то не своим, очень высоким голосом.

В ответ откуда-то послышался жуткий лай и девять огромных псов в ошейниках, обитых медью, вприпрыжку влетели на гумно. Лязгая клыками, они стрелой ринулись прямо на Снежка, который едва успел соскочить со своего места. Через минуту он был уже за воротами, а псы мчались за ним. Пораженные и испуганные, не в силах вымолвить ни слова, животные покинули гумно и, следя за погоней, столпились за его воротами.

Снежок мчался по длинному лугу, примыкавшему к дороге. Он бежал со всех ног, но псы гнались за ним по пятам. Один раз Снежок поскользнулся и показалось, будто сейчас его схватят, но он вскочил и понесся с удвоенной скоростью. Псы, однако, опять стали настигать его. Один из них цапнул было Снежка за хвостик, но Снежок дернулся, сделал еще один рывок и, опередив собак всего на несколько дюймов, проскользнул через дырку в живой изгороди и исчез.

Испуганные и притихшие, животные вернулись на гумно. Псы прискакали через минуту. В первые мгновения погони никто не мог сообразить, откуда взялись эти бестии, но теперь животных осенила догадка: это были те самые щенки, которых растил Наполеон. Хотя они были еще не вполне взрослыми, но уже превратились в огромных, свирепых как волки, псов. Они жались к Наполеону. Все заметили, что они научились вилять перед ним хвостом, как другие собаки делали это перед мистером Джонсом.

В сопровождении псов, не отступавших от него ни на шаг, Наполеон поднялся на помост, с которого Майор некогда произнес свою историческую речь, и выступил с коротким объявлением.

- Отныне, - прохрюкал он, - утренние Советы по воскресеньям отменяются. В них нет никакой нужды, это пустая трата времени. Впредь все вопросы, относящиеся к работе фермы, будет решаться специальным комитетом свиней под его собственным, Наполеона, председательством. Комитет свиней будет заседать при закрытых дверях, а потом объявлять о своих решениях. По воскресеньям утром звери будут по-прежнему собираться - для того, чтобы салютовать знамени, петь "Всех животных Британии" и получать задания на предстоящую неделю, но никаких дебатов отныне не будет.

Хотя животные были потрясены и напуганы изгнанием Снежка, они встретили это объявление с неудовольствием. Сумей они найти подходящие слова, они бы, пожалуй, запротестовали. Даже Боксер ощутил смутное беспокойство. Он пошевелил ушами, тряхнул несколько раз гривой, усиленно стараясь привести свои мысли в порядок, но так и не смог придумать ничего путного.

Однако среди самих свиней не все утратили способность владеть членораздельной речью. Четыре молоденьких борова в первом ряду издали несколько пронзительных визгов - в знак своего неодобрения - и, вскочив на ноги, захрюкали все четверо одновременно. Но псы, сидевшие вокруг Наполеона, угрожающе зарычали, и свиньи смолкли и сели. Тут овцы разразились громким блеянием "Четыре - хорошо...", которое продлилось около четверти часа и сделало невозможным продолжение дискуссии.

Когда все разошлись, разъяснить новые порядки опять послали Визгуна.

- Товарищи звери, - хрюкал он, - я уверен, что все правильно поняли ту жертву, которую принес товарищ Наполеон, взяв на себя эту нелегкую работу. Не думайте, товарищи, что быть Вождем очень приятно. Напротив, эта высокая и тяжелая ответственность. Наполеон более чем кто-либо верен принципу "Все звери равны". И он был бы только счастлив позволить вам самим принимать ответственные решения. Но вдруг вы однажды примете неверное решение, товарищи, и что тогда? Предположим, вы бы последовали за Снежком и его маниакальной идеей ветряной мельницы, за Снежком, который, как теперь выяснилось, был обыкновенным преступником?

- Он храбро сражался в Битве при Коровнике, - возразил кто-то.

- Храбрость - это еще не все, - парировал возражение Визгун. - На нынешнем этапе важнее верность и повиновение. А что касается Битвы при Коровнике, то я думаю, придет время, и мы убедимся, что роль Снежка в этой битве преувеличивалась. Дисциплина, товарищи, же-лез-на-я дисциплина! Вот главный лозунг наших дней. Один неверный шаг - и враги нас одолеют. Ведь вы, товарищи, не хотите возвращения Джонса?

И опять этот довод подействовал неотразимо. Разумеется, никто не хотел возвращения фермера Джонса, и если прения и споры на утренних Советах по воскресеньям могли к этому привести, значит, эти споры следует принести в жертву. Боксер, который к этому времени успел обдумать случившееся, выразил общее мнения словами: "Если товарищ Наполеон так считает, значит, так оно и есть". С тех пор афоризм "Наполеон всегда прав" Боксер сделал дополнением к своему личному девизу "Я буду работать еще упорней".

Тем временем погода разгулялась, и животные смогли приступить к весенней пахоте. Сарай, где Снежок работал над своими чертежами, был заперт на замок и, как полагали животные, с пола они были стерты. Каждое воскресенье в 10 часов утра животные собирались теперь на гумне для того, чтобы выслушать приказания на предстоящую неделю. В саду откопали череп старого Майора, уже очистившийся от плоти, и установили его на столбике у подножия флагштока, рядом с ружьем. Теперь после подъема флага животные должны были рядами и колоннами в благоговении шествовать мимо черепа и только после этого входили на гумно. На гумне они уже не сидели все вместе. Наполеон, Визгун и еще одна свинья по кличке Минимус, обладавшая замечательным даром стихосложения и сочинения песен, садились в первом ряду на помосте вместе с девятью молодыми псами, которые полукругом охватывали их с тыла, а остальные свиньи располагались позади псов. Все прочие животные садились в основной части гумна лицом к свиньям и собакам. Наполеон оглашал свои приказания на неделю по-военному кратко. После этого, хором исполнив "Всех животных Британии", животные расходились.

На третье воскресенье после изгнания Снежка обитатели фермы были до некоторой степени удивлены, услышав объявление Наполеона о том, что мельница все-таки будет построена. Он ничего не сказал о причинах, которые заставили его передумать, и только предупредил, что эта сверхурочная работа будет нелегкой и что, возможно, придется упорядочить продовольственные нормы. Все планы, однако, были уже готовы вплоть до последней детали. Специальный комитет свиней разрабатывал их целых три недели. Предполагалось, что строительство мельницы вместе с разными другими усовершенствованиями займет два года.

В тот же вечер Визгун в неофициальном порядке объяснил животным, что Наполеон никогда, в сущности, не был противником мельницы. Наоборот, именно Наполеон первым выдвинул эту идею, да и чертежи, которые Снежок чертил на полу сарая-инкубатора, на самом деле были выкрадены из бумаг Наполеона. В действительности же ветряную мельницу изобрел Наполеон.

- Почему тогда, - спросил кто-то Визгуна, - он так резко выступал против нее?

Тут Визгун напустил на себя очень лукавый вид.

- Это, - говорил он, - была военная хитрость товарища Наполеона. Он только делал вид, что выступает против мельницы, маневрируя с целью устранить Снежка, который был опасной личностью и оказывал дурное влияние. Теперь, когда Снежок ушел с дороги, этот план можно осуществить без помех. Это, - говорил Визгун, - называется тактикой.

- Тактика, товарищи! Тактика! - хрюкнул он несколько раз с веселым смешком, припрыгивая и дергая хвостиком.

Животные не поняли в точности, что значит это слово, но Визгун хрюкал так решительно, а три пса, которые его сопровождали, рычали так свирепо, что они приняли все объяснения без дальнейших расспросов.

Глава шестая

Весь этот год животные работали как проклятые. Но своими трудами они были довольны. Никакие тяготы не казались им напрасными: они хорошо знали, что трудятся на себя и себе подобных, на благо своих потомков, а не на шайку праздных двуногих грабителей.

В течение всей весны и всего лета они работали по шестьдесят часов в неделю, а в августе Наполеон объявил, что отныне вводятся еще и послеобеденные работы по воскресеньям. Эти сверхурочные работы были сугубо добровольными, но кормовая пайка тех, кто на них не ходил, сокращалась наполовину. Но даже после этого от части планов пришлось отказаться. Урожай был меньше, чем в прошлом году, а два поля, которые предполагалось занять под корнеплоды, к лету так и не были засеяны, потому что вспашка не была закончена вовремя. Нетрудно было предвидеть, что зима предстоит трудная.

Мельница рождала одну нежданную трудность за другой. На ферме имелся прекрасный карьер, где добывался известняк, в одном из сараев нашлись изрядные запасы песка и цемента, так что все строительные материалы были под рукой. Но была задача, которая сначала никак не поддавалась разрешению: как расколоть каменные глыбы на куски подходящего размера. Казалось, что нет другого пути, кроме как колоть их киркой и ломом, а никто из животных не был в состоянии удержать эти инструменты. Для этого нужно было твердо стоять на задних лапах. Только после недели тщетных усилий кому-то пришла в голову счастливая мысль: использовать закон тяготения.

Огромные валуны, слишком большие, чтобы их можно было пустить в дело, валялись по всему карьеру. Животные обвязывали их веревками, а потом все вместе - коровы, лошади, овцы - все, кто мог тянуть веревку (иногда в самые решительные моменты присоединялись и свиньи), очень медленно втаскивали их по склону карьера наверх, а там сталкивали с откоса, чтобы, падая, они сами разбивались внизу на части. Перевозка битого камня была уже делом сравнительно простым. Лошади доставляли камень на телегах, овцы катали отдельные куски, даже Мюриель и Бенджамин впрягались в старую двуколку с сиденьями по бокам и тем вносили свою лепту в общие усилия. К концу лета насобирали нужный запас камня и тогда началось, под руководством свиней, строительство.

Но это был процесс медленный и трудоемкий. Изнурительные усилия по подъему одного-единственного валуна наверх карьера часто занимали целый день, а когда его сталкивали вниз, он мог иногда не разбиться. Без Боксера ничего было бы нельзя достигнуть. Казалось, что у него сил больше, чем у всех остальных животных, вместе взятых. Когда валун, который затаскивали наверх, вдруг начинал скользить обратно, и все вопили от отчаяния, видя, что их тащит вниз по склону, - именно Боксер вступал в напряженную борьбу с веревкой и останавливал скольжение.

Животные восторгались, видя, как он поднимается вверх по склону, пядь за пядью, с натугой, как его дыхание учащается, а крутые бока покрываются потом. Кашка иногда просила его быть поосторожнее, но Боксер ее не слушался. У него было два ответа на все - слова "Я буду работать еще упорнее" и "Наполеон всегда прав". Он попросил петуха, чтобы тот будил его по утрам не на полчаса, как прежде, а на три четверти часа раньше остальных. А в свободные минуты, которых теперь было немного, он отправлялся в карьер один, собирал битый камень и без чьей-либо помощи возил его к будущей мельнице.

Несмотря на многочисленные тяготы, этим летом на ферме жилось не так уж и плохо. Если еды у них и не прибавилось по сравнению с временами мистера Джонса, то по крайней мере и не убавилось. Одно то, что они должны были кормить только самих себя и не были обязаны содержать еще и пятерых прожорливых двуногих нахлебников, было немалым преимуществом, которое перевешивало многие неудачи. Методы труда животных во многих случаях были эффективнее и экономичнее. Например, такую работу, как прополку полей от сорняков, можно было сделать с тщательностью, людям недоступной.

И опять же, поскольку животные теперь не травили посевы, отпала необходимость отгораживать пахотные земли от пастбищ и все время возобновлять живые изгороди и проходы в них. Это давало немалую экономию труда.

Тем не менее, уже в течение этого лета обнаружились и дали о себе знать многие непредвиденные трудности. Не хватало керосина, гвоздей, веревок, собачьих сухарей, железа для подков - самим произвести все это на ферме было невозможно. А в будущем предстояло столкнуться с недостатком семян и искусственных удобрений, не говоря уж о различных инструментах и оборудовании для мельницы. Откуда все это возьмется, никто не мог себе даже представить.

Однажды в воскресенье утром, когда животные собрались для получения приказаний на следующую неделю, Наполеон объявил, что переходит к новой политике. С этого дня Зверская Ферма завяжет торговые отношения с соседними фермами - разумеется, не ради коммерческой выгоды, а единственно для того, чтобы обеспечить себя самыми необходимыми вещами. "Потребности мельницы должны быть поставлены во главу угла", - сказал он. Поэтому он, Наполеон, ведет сейчас переговоры о продаже стога сена и части урожая пшеницы текущего года, ну, а если денег все-таки не хватит, то придется заработать их продажей яиц, на которые всегда есть спрос в Виллингдоне. "Куры, - сказал Наполеон, - должны поддержать эту жертву, как свой личный вклад в строительство мельницы".

Снова животные ощутили смутное беспокойство. Разве среди прежних постановлений, принятых сразу после изгнания Джонса на первом, триумфальном Совете, не было решения никогда не заключать сделок с людьми, никогда не заниматься торговлей, никогда не прикасаться к деньгам? Все животные помнили, как принимали эти постановления, или, по крайней мере, им казалось, что они помнят. Четыре юных борова, те самые, что протестовали, когда Наполеон упразднил Советы, робко подняли голос, но тут же и смолкли, заслышав угрожающее рычание псов. Овцы, как обычно, заблеяли: "Четыре хорошо, два - плохо", и минутное замешательство сгладилось.

В заключение Наполеон простер ножку вверх, призывая к молчанию, и объявил, что он уже обо всем распорядился. Животным не придется вступать в непосредственный контакт с двуногими. Эту неприятную обязанность он целиком берет на себя. Стряпчий из Виллингдона мистер Вимпер согласился выступать в качестве посредника между Зверской Фермой и внешним миром. Каждый понедельник он будет в утренние часы посещать ферму для получения инструкций. Наполеон закончил свое выступление обычным призывом "Да здравствует Зверская Ферма!", после чего, спев "Животных Британии", все разошлись.

В тот же день Визгун обошел всю ферму и навел должный порядок в мыслях и чувствах животных. Он заверил их, что постановление против денег и торговли не только никогда не принималось, но даже и не выносилась на обсуждение. Это чистейшей воды измышление, возможно, восходящее в своих истоках к лживым инсинуациям Снежка. У некоторых животных были все-таки неясные сомнения, но Визгун жестко спросил у них: "А вы уверены, товарищи, что это вам не приснилось? У вас что - есть протоколы того Совета? Это постановление было где-нибудь записано?" И так как то, что никаких записей о постановлении у них не сохранилось, была истинная правда, животные поняли, что ошибались.

Мистер Вимпер, как было уговорено, посещал ферму каждый понедельник. Это был плутоватый на вид субъект невысокого роста с бакенбардами - мелкий делец с некоторыми юридическими познаниями, раньше других сообразивший, что Зверской Ферме понадобится посредник и что на этом можно неплохо подзаработать. Животные относились к Вимперу с подозрением и опаской и, насколько это было возможно, обходили его стороной. И все-таки, когда они видели, как их четвероногий собрат Наполеон отдает приказания двуногому Вимперу, это зрелище возбуждало в них горделивое чувство и отчасти примиряло с этим новшеством.

Их отношения с человеческим родом несколько изменились. Теперь, когда Зверская Ферма процветала, двуногие ненавидели ее ничуть не меньше, а скорее даже больше. Люди свято верили в то, что ферма рано или поздно обанкротится, а из затеи с мельницей просто ничего не выйдет. Встречаясь в пивных, они при помощи диаграмм доказывали друг другу, что стены мельницы неизбежно должны рухнуть, а если даже и устоят, то все равно крылья мельницы никогда не будут крутиться.

И все же они невольно стали относиться с некоторым уважением к умению животных управлять своими делами. Во всяком случае, они признали новое название фермы и перестали поддерживать Джонса, который оставил надежду вернуть себе ферму, покинул Виллингдон и переселился на другой конец страны. Между Зверской Фермой и внешним миром не было никаких других контактов, кроме тех, которые поддерживались через Вимпера, но все время возникали слухи, что Наполеон собирается заключить какое-то торговое соглашение: то с мистером Пилькингтоном из Фоксвуда, то с мистером Фредериком из Пинчфильда. И что любопытно, никогда с обоими одновременно.

Примерно в это же время свиньи вдруг перебрались в дом фермера. Животным снова показалось, что они помнят какое-то давнее постановление против этого, но Визгун опять сумел переубедить их.

- Совершенно необходимо, - хрюкал он, - чтобы свиньи - ум, честь и совесть нашей фермы, имели спокойное место для работы. И достоинству Вождя (а в последнее время, говоря о Наполеоне, он стал употреблять слово "Вождь") более подобает жить в доме, чем в свинарнике.

Кое-кто был все-таки обеспокоен, когда пронесся слух, что свиньи не только готовят себе пищу на кухне и превратили гостиную в комнату отдыха, но к тому же еще и спят на кроватях. Боксер, как обычно, сказал, что "Наполеон всегда прав", но Кашка, которой показалось, будто она помнит четкое и ясное законоположение против кроватей, отправилась к гумну и попыталась разобраться, что же там написано об этом в Семи Заповедях. Убедившись в своей неспособности понять что-нибудь, кроме отдельных букв, она позвала Мюриель.

- Мюриель, - попросила она, - прочти мне Четвертую Заповедь. Не запрещает ли она спать в кровати?

Хотя и не без затруднений, коза прочитала заповедь вслух:

- Там сказано: "Зверь да не спит в кровати НА ПРОСТЫНЯХ", - проблеяла она наконец.

Странно, но Кашка не помнила, чтобы в Четвертой заповеди упоминались простыни. Но раз уж так было написано на стене, сомневаться не приходилось. Случайно проходивший мимо Визгун, сопровождаемый двумя или тремя псами, тут же все надлежащим образом разъяснил.

- Вы, товарищи, уже слышали, что мы спим на кроватях? - спросил он. - А почему бы и нет? Ведь вы же не думаете, что это запрещено? Слово "кровать" означает, собственно, "место, где спят". Строго говоря, груда соломы - это тоже кровать. Закон запрещает спать на простыне, которая действительно является вредной людской выдумкой. Мы убрали все простыни с кроватей и спим на одеялах. Да, это удобно. Но могу вам сказать, товарищи, не удобнее, чем мы того заслуживаем! Ибо сколько трудов и забот ложится на наши плечи! А ведь и нам надо иногда отдохнуть! Ведь вы же не хотите, чтобы мы надорвались на работе и уже не могли больше выполнять свои обязанности? Ведь никто из вас не хочет, чтобы Джонс вернулся?

Животные тут же заверили его в обратном, и толки о спящих в кроватях свиньях прекратились. А когда через несколько дней Визгун объявил, что свиньи отныне по утрам будут вставать на час позже других зверей, то жалоб и недовольства по этому поводу не возникло.

К осени животные буквально падали от усталости, но были довольны собой. Год выдался тяжелый, и запасы пищи на зиму - после продажи части урожая зерна и сена - не были слишком обильны, но мельница искупала все. Она была возведена уже наполовину. После жатвы случилось несколько сухих и ясных деньков, и животные налегли в эти дни на работу еще усерднее, чем раньше. Они полагали, что есть смысл потратить больше сил на добычу камня, лишь бы поднять стены мельницы еще на один фут. Боксер даже вставал по ночам, чтобы в одиночестве часок-другой поработать при свете полной осенней луны.

В свободные минуты животные прохаживались вокруг наполовину отстроенной мельницы, восхищаясь мощью и прямизной ее стен и поражаясь, как это им все удалось. Только старый Бенджамин не выражал никакого энтузиазма насчет мельницы, хотя по обыкновению помалкивал. Он только загадочно бурчал, что "ослы живут долго", и большего от него невозможно было добиться.

В ноябре задули яростные юго-западные ветры. Строительство пришлось остановить, потому что дожди не давали замешивать цементный раствор. Однажды ночью случился такой страшный ураган, что все постройки фермы заходили ходуном, а с крыши амбара посыпалась черепица. Тревожно кудахтая, в страхе проснулись куры, потому что им всем одновременно приснился отдаленный ружейный выстрел. Утром животные вышли из стойл и сараев и увидели, что флагшток сломан, а в нижнем конце сада валяется вяз, вырванный, как редиска, с корнем. Но то, что они увидели вслед за этим, вызвало общий вопль отчаяния. Ужасное зрелище предстало пред их глазами: мельница лежала в развалинах!

Животные устремились туда все как один. Наполеон, который вообще-то бегал редко, на этот раз сам скакал впереди всех. Да, мельница рухнула до основания, а камни, которые они разбивали и перетаскивали с таким трудом, были разбросаны вокруг. Не в силах произнести ни слова, они стояли, скорбно глядя на груду упавших камней. Наполеон в молчании расхаживал взад и вперед, время от времени принюхиваясь к земле. Хвостик его стоял торчком, судорожно подрагивая из стороны в сторону, что у него всегда было признаком напряженной умственной деятельности. Вдруг он резко остановился, как будто придя к какому-то решению.

- Товарищи, - начал он негромко, - знаете ли вы, кто виноват в этом? Кто этот враг, проникший сюда под покровом темноты и уничтоживший нашу мельницу? СНЕЖОК!!! - Он вдруг перешел на крик, и в голосе его зазвучала угроза, - Снежок сделал это! Этот злобный предатель, думая нарушить наши планы и отомстить за свое позорное изгнание, проник сюда под покровом ночи и уничтожил плоды наших самоотверженных трудов! Товарищи! На этом самом месте я выношу смертный приговор Снежку! Звание "Зверь-Герой" второй степени и ведро яблок тому из вас, кто свершит над ним справедливый суд! Два ведра тому зверю, кто захватит его живым!

Животные были невероятно потрясены, узнав, что это Снежок - виновник столь ужасного злодеяния. Такого никто не ожидал даже от Снежка. Раздались крики возмущения, и все вслух стали изобретать свои способы поимки Снежка, если он когда-нибудь опять попытается вернуться. Почти сразу же на небольшом расстоянии от холма нашли в траве следы какой-то свиньи. Они прослеживались всего лишь на протяжении нескольких ярдов, но вели по направлению к дыре в живой изгороди. Наполеон глубоко внюхался в них и подтвердил, что это следы Снежка. По мнению Наполеона, Снежок скорее всего пришел со стороны фермы Фоксвуд.

- Медлить нельзя, товарищи! - сказал Наполеон, изучив следы преступника. - У нас много работы! Мы приступим к восстановлению мельницы сегодня же утром и будем строить ее всю зиму, не пропуская ни единого дня, невзирая на погоду. Мы покажем этому презренному предателю, что ему не удастся так легко погубить наш труд. Помните, товарищи, ни шага в сторону! Мельница будет сдана в запланированный срок! Вперед, товарищи, к победе Зверизма! Да здравствует мельница! Да здравствует Зверская Ферма!

Глава седьмая

Зима выдалась суровая. За штормовыми ветрами последовал мокрый снег с дождем и градом, а потом грянули холода, которые свирепствовали до середины февраля. Восстанавливая мельницу, животные старались изо всех сил, прекрасно понимая, что внешний мир следит за ними, и как завистливые двуногие будут радоваться и торжествовать, если они не возведут мельницу в срок.

Злобствуя, двуногие делали вид, что они не верят в виновность Снежка. Они утверждали, что Снежок тут совершенно не при чем, а виной всему, дескать, просто тонкие стены мельницы. Животные, конечно, понимали, что это неправда. И все-таки на этот раз было решено класть стены в три фута толщиной, а не восемнадцати дюймов, как раньше, а это значило, что камней теперь потребуется вдвое больше. Карьер долгое время был занесен снегом, и с этим ничего нельзя было поделать.

Дело несколько продвинулось в пору наступивших вскоре сухих морозов, но это был адский труд, а надежды уже не согревали их так, как в первый раз. Они мерзли и редко бывали сыты. Только Боксер и Кашка никогда не падали духом. Визгун произносил зажигательные речи о радости служения и о трудовых доблестях, но животных больше воодушевлял Боксер со своим вечным девизом: "Я буду работать еще упорней!"

В январе еды стало еще меньше. Зерновую пайку сильно сократили, а взамен были обещаны дополнительные выдачи картошки. Но тут оказалось, что почти весь урожай картофеля померз в буртах, прикрытых слишком тонким слоем земли и соломы. Картофель размяк, почернел, и только малая часть его была съедобна.

В эти дни животным целыми днями ничего, кроме кормовой свеклы и мякины, не выдавали. Казалось, что на пороге стоит голодная смерть. Было жизненно необходимо скрыть этот факт от внешнего мира. Ободренные разрушением мельницы, двуногие и так распространяли лживые выдумки о Зверской Ферме. Они вновь стали утверждать, что животные там вымирают от голода и болезней, все время ведут междоусобную борьбу и даже докатились до поедания друг друга и истребления новорожденных.

Наполеон хорошо предвидел все дурные последствия утечки информации о действительном положении с продуктами и, чтобы создать обратное впечатление, решил использовать мистера Вимпера. До сих пор животные почти не общались с Вимпером во время его еженедельных визитов, а теперь несколько специально подобранных животных, в основном овец, получили задание упоминать в его присутствии, как бы случайно, что пайка недавно опять увеличилась. Кроме того, Наполеон велел почти до краев наполнить песком опустевшие закрома в амбаре, а сверху этот песок присыпали остатками зерна и муки. Использовав какой-то подходящий предлог, Вимпера провели через склад, позволив одним глазом заглянуть в закрома. Вимпер был введен в заблуждение и продолжал уверять внешний мир, что продовольствия на Зверской Ферме сколько угодно.

И все-таки к концу января стало ясно, что зерно необходимо где-то доставать. В эти дни Наполеон редко появлялся на публике и большую часть своего времени проводил в доме, где его оберегали девять свирепых псов, стороживших каждую дверь. Его редкие выходы обставлялись торжественно: шесть псов окружали его плотным кольцом и рычали, если кто-нибудь подходил слишком близко. Бывало, что он вообще не показывался утром в воскресенье, и тогда его распоряжения передавались через других свиней, чаще всего через Визгуна.

Однажды в воскресенье утром Визгун объявил, что куры, которые только что стали снова нестись, должны будут сдать свои яйца, потому что Наполеон заключил через Вимпера контракт на поставку четырех сотен яиц в неделю. Денег, которые будут выручены за яйца, должно было хватить на зерно и муку, чтобы дотянуть до следующего урожая.

Услышав об этом, куры страшно раскудахтались. Конечно, им намекали и раньше, что такая жертва, может быть, от них потребуется, но им в это не хотелось верить. Они только что собрались высиживать весенних цыплят и теперь запротестовали, утверждая, что продажа яиц равна детоубийству. Впервые со времен изгнания Джонса произошло нечто вроде мятежа. Под предводительством трех черных минорок куры-несушки предприняли явную попытку расстроить планы Наполеона. Они выбрали такой способ сопротивления: взлетели на насесты и неслись оттуда прямо на пол, где яйца, естественно, разбивались.

Наполеон действовал быстро и беспощадно. Распорядившись прекратить выдачу курам кормов, он постановил, что любое животное, которое поделится с ними хоть зернышком, подлежит смертной казни. Псы следили за тем, чтобы этот декрет неукоснительно соблюдался. Куры продержались пять дней, а потом сдались и вернулись к своим ящикам для яиц. Девять несушек за это время передохли. Их тушки сожгли в саду, а причиной смерти была объявлена куриная слепота. Вимпер об этом инциденте даже не узнал. Яйца поставлялись, как было условлено, и фургон бакалейщика заезжал за ними каждую неделю.

Все это время о Снежке не было ни слуху, ни духу. Поговаривали, что он скрывается на одной из соседних ферм - то ли в Фоксвуде, то ли в Пинчфильде. Отношения Наполеона с соседями теперь несколько наладились. Во дворе фермы лежала куча бревен, сложенных там еще лет десять тому назад после расчистки буковой рощи. За это время бревна хорошо высохли, и Вимпер посоветовал Наполеону продать их. И мистер Пилькингтон, и мистер Фредерик были бы не прочь совершить эту покупку. Наполеон колебался и все не мог решить, кого же из них предпочесть. Замечали, что когда он склонялся к мысли заключить контракт с Фредериком, Визгун утверждал, что Снежок скрывается в Фоксвуде, а когда казалось, что Наполеон предпочитает Пилькингтона, о Снежке говорилось, что он обосновался в Пинчфильде.

В начале весны вдруг обнаружилось, что Снежок посещает ферму по ночам. Это известие ошеломило животных. Они так переполошились, что с трудом засыпали в своих сараях. Рассказывали, что Снежок пробирается на ферму под покровом темноты каждую ночь и творит всяческие безобразия. Он крал зерно, переворачивал ведра с молоком, бил яйца, вытаптывал посевы, обдирал клыками кору плодовых деревьев. Что бы ни стряслось - во всем винили Снежка. Разбивалось ли окно, запруживались ли канава - кто-нибудь обязательно говорил, что это вредительство Снежка. Поэтому когда потерялся ключ от продовольственного склада, то вся ферма была в полной уверенности, что Снежок забросил его в колодец. Странно, но они продолжали верить в это, даже когда потерянный ключ нашелся под мешком из-под муки. Коровы в один голос мычали, что Снежок забирается к ним в коровник и доит их во сне. Поговаривали, что даже крысы, совершенно обнаглевшие этой зимой, вступили в сговор со Снежком.

Наполеон приказал провести тщательное расследование злодеяний предателя. В сопровождении своих псов он устроил инспекционный обход всей фермы. Все остальные животные следовали за ним на почтительном расстоянии. Наполеон останавливался через каждые несколько шагов и нюхал землю в поисках следов Снежка. По его словам, он узнавал их по запаху. Он перенюхал каждый угол в гумне, в коровнике, курятнике, огороде и почти везде обнаружил следы Снежка. Он тыкал рылом в землю, делал несколько глубоких вздохов и восклицал зловещим голосом:

- Снежок! Он был здесь! Я чую этот изменнический дух!

При слове "Снежок" псы скалили свои клыки и рычали так, что кровь стыла в жилах.

Животные были запуганы до смерти. Им казалось, что Снежок стал какой-то невидимой силой, которая витала в воздухе, угрожая им всеми возможными бедами.

Вечером Визгун собрал всех обитателей фермы и, встревоженно морща рыло, сказал им, что у него есть важные новости.

- Товарищи! - заверещал Визгун, нервно подпрыгивая. - Товарищи! Открылась ужасная вещь! Снежок продался Фредерику из Пинчфильда, который как раз сейчас замышляет напасть на нас и отнять у нас нашу ферму. Снежок будет у Фредерика проводником. Хуже того. Ранее мы полагали, что мятеж Снежка был следствием его самолюбия и тщеславия. Мы ошибались, товарищи. Знаете, каковы были истинные причины? Снежок был в сговоре с Джонсом с самого начала! Снежок всегда был тайным агентом Джонса. Это доказывают оставшиеся после него документы, которые мы только сейчас обнаружили. По-моему, это объясняет многое, товарищи. Разве мы не видели сами, как он пытался - к счастью, без успеха - привести нас к поражению и разгрому в Битве при Коровнике.

Животные были ошеломлены. Даже разрушение мельницы не шло ни в какое сравнение с этим предательством. Однако прошло все же несколько минут, прежде чем они поверили в это. Все они вспомнили - или подумали, что вспомнили, - как Снежок вел их в атаку в Битве при Коровнике, как он их сплачивал и ободрял на каждом шагу, и как даже ранение дробью ни на миг не остановило его. Все это как-то не вязалось с тем, что он был на стороне Джонса. Даже Боксер, который редко задавал лишние вопросы, был озадачен. Он лег, подобрал под себя передние копыта, закрыл глаза и с тяжким усилием попытался выразить свою мысль:

- Я в это не верю... Снежок храбро сражался в Битве при Коровнике. Я сам видел это. Разве мы не присвоили ему звание "Зверь-Герой" первой степени сразу же после битвы?

- Это была наша ошибка, товарищи. Теперь-то мы знаем, что в действительности он пытался погубить нас. Обо всем этом написано в секретных документах, которые теперь нашлись.

- Но он был ранен! - сказал Боксер. - Мы все видели, как он истекал кровью.

- Это было подстроено! - верещал Визгун. - Выстрел Джонса только слегка задел его. - Я бы показал, что об этом сказано в его собственных воспоминаниях, если бы вы умели читать. Замысел Снежка заключался вот в чем. В решающий момент он должен был подать сигнал к отступлению и таким образом оставить врагу поле боя. И ему бы удалось это, если бы не наш героический вождь товарищ Наполеон! Вы что, не помните, что как раз в ту минуту, когда всех охватила паника и казалось, что все потеряно, товарищ Наполеон выступил вперед с кличем "Смерть человечеству!" и вонзил свои клыки в ногу Джонса? Вы помните это? - вопил Визгун, прыгая из стороны в сторону.

Теперь, когда Визгун описал сцену столь живописно, животным показалось, что они вспомнили ее. Во всяком случае, они припомнили, что в решающую минуту Снежок действительно побежал. Но Боксер не унимался.

- Я не верю, что Снежок всегда был предателем, - сказал он. - Другое дело, что он натворил потом. Но я уверен, что в Битве при Коровнике он еще был добрым товарищем.

- Наш Вождь, товарищ Наполеон, - возгласил Визгун, выговаривая слова размеренно и твердо, - утверждает категорически, товарищи, что Снежок был агентом Джонса еще с тех времен, когда о Восстании никто и думать не думал! Категорически!

- Ну, это другое дело! - сказал Боксер. - Если сам товарищ Наполеон так говорит, значит, так оно и есть.

- Вот это уже патриотически сказано! - хрюкнул Визгун, но глянул на Боксера своими мигающими глазками весьма угрожающе. Уходя, он многозначительно добавил:

- Я предостерегаю всех и каждого: смотреть нужно в оба! У нас есть основания полагать, что секретные агенты Снежка и в эту минуту таятся среди нас!

Четыре дня спустя Наполеон приказал животным собраться во дворе после обеда. Когда все были в сборе, Наполеон вышел из дома. Недавно он удостоил себя званиями "Зверь-Герой" первой степени и "Зверь-Герой" второй степени, и оба эти ордена болтались у него на груди. Девять громадных псов прыгали вокруг Наполеона и рычали так, что у всех мурашки бегали по спинам.

Все молчаливо сжались на своих местах и, казалось, предчувствовали, что сейчас произойдет нечто ужасное.

Наполеон постоял, строгим взором оглядел присутствующих и вдруг пронзительно хрюкнул. Псы тотчас рванулись вперед и, схватив за уши четырех свиней, поволокли их, визжащих от боли и страха, к ногам Вождя. Из прокушенных ушей хлестала кровь, псы почувствовали ее вкус и, казалось, на несколько мгновений совершенно взбесились. Трое псов, ко всеобщему изумлению, бросились на Боксера. Первый пес был перехвачен копытом Боксера еще в прыжке и сразу же прижат к земле. Пес взвыл о пощаде, а два других, поджав хвосты, отскочили. Боксер взглянул на Вождя, как бы спрашивая, что ему делать дальше. Наполеон, казалось, передумал и, скрывая испуг, строго приказал отпустить пса. Боксер приподнял копыто, и помятый пес с воем метнулся прочь.

Суматоха улеглась. Четверо обвиняемых ждали, всем своим видом свидетельствуя о совершенных преступлениях. Наполеон потребовал, чтобы злодеи покаялись. Это были те самые четыре кабанчика, которые протестовали, когда Наполеон отменил Советы по воскресеньям. Других подсказок не требовалось. Те признались, что с момента изгнания Снежка поддерживали с ним тайные сношения, содействовали Снежку в разрушении мельницы, вошли в сговор со Снежком с целью передать Зверскую Ферму в руки Фредерику. Они также добавили, что Снежок доверительно признавался им, что был в прошлом тайным агентом Джонса. Как только они закончили свое покаяние, псы тут же перегрызли им глотки, а Наполеон зловеще вопросил, нет ли еще желающих в чем-нибудь покаяться.

Вперед вышли три черные минорки, зачинщицы яичного бунта, и признались, что Снежок явился им во сне, подстрекая к неповиновению Наполеону. Их тут же прикончили. За ними вышел гусь и повинился, что утаил шесть початков кукурузы с прошлого урожая и ел их по ночам. За ним овца призналась в том, что помочилась в общую поилку по наущению, конечно же, Снежка, а две другие овцы признались в убийстве одного старого барана, особенно верного приверженца Наполеона. Несчастного барана, страдавшего от кашля, они довели до смерти, гоняя его вокруг костра. Они тоже были казнены на месте.

Череда покаяний и расправ продолжалась до тех пор, пока у ног Наполеона не образовалась гора трупов, и самый воздух не пропитался забытым со времен Джонса тяжелым запахом крови.

Когда резня прекратилась, все, кроме свиней и псов, гуртом побрели прочь. Они были потрясены и опечалены. Они даже не знали, что их ужаснуло больше: измена своих товарищей, продавшихся Снежку, или жестокое возмездие, свидетелями которого они стали. Кровавые сцены им приходилось наблюдать и прежде, однако то, что произошло сегодня, показалось им ужаснее чего бы то ни было, потому что случилось между своими. С тех пор, как Джонс покинул ферму, животные не убивали друг друга. Даже крыс никто не трогал.

Они поднялись на пригорок неподалеку от наполовину отстроенной мельницы. Чтобы было теплее, они сбились в тесную кучу, здесь были Кашка, Мюриель, Бенджамин, коровы, овцы и вся стая гусей и кур - все, кроме кошки, внезапно исчезнувшей как раз накануне устроенной Наполеоном экзекуции. Некоторое время все лежали молча. Один Боксер остался на ногах. Он дергался, хлестал себя по бокам длинным черным хвостом, время от времени выражал свое недоумение коротким и негромким ржанием. Наконец, он сказал:

- Не понимаю. Я бы не поверил, что такое может случиться на нашей ферме. Должно быть, мы допустили какие-то серьезные ошибки. Вывод, я думаю, один: надо работать упорнее. С сегодняшнего дня я буду вставать по утрам на час раньше. - И тяжелой рысью Боксер ускакал на карьер. Там он в качестве разминки перед сном набрал два воза камней и отволок их один за другим на мельницу.

Сгрудившись вокруг Кашки, животные тесно жались друг к другу. С холма, на котором они лежали, открывался широкий вид на окрестности. Большая часть фермы лежала перед их взорами: длинный луг, простиравшийся до главной дороги, поле, засеянное кормовыми травами, роща, пруд с питьевой водой, пахотные земли, где густо зеленела молодая пшеница, красные крыши хозяйственных строений, из труб которых вился дымок.

Был ясный весенний вечер. Трава и распускавшийся кустарник живой изгороди отливали золотом под косыми лучами солнца. Никогда еще ферма не казалась им столь желанным местом - и с каким-то даже удивлением они вспомнили, что это их собственная ферма, где каждый клочок земли принадлежит им.

Кашка смотрела с холма, и ее глаза наполнялись слезами. Если бы она смогла выразить свои мысли, то сказала бы, что совсем не ради того, что случилось сегодня, они затеяли несколько лет тому назад борьбу против тирании двуногих. Эти сцены страха и резни - нет, не этого они ждали в ту ночь, когда старый Майор призвал их к Восстанию. Сама она представляла себе будущее, если вообще как-то представляла, как сообщество животных, свободных от голода и бичей, где все равны, каждый трудится по способностям и сильный оберегает слабого, как сама она оберегала в ту ночь потерявшихся утят, загородив их своими ногами. Она не знала почему, но вместо этого они дожили до того, что никто уже не осмеливается высказать вслух то, что думает; повсюду рыщут жестокие и злобные псы, и на твоих глазах твои собственные товарищи признаются в ужасных преступлениях и гибнут, разорванные в клочья. У нее не было и мысли о мятеже или неповиновении. Она знала, что даже теперь все-таки лучше, чем при Джонсе, что самое главное - это предотвратить возвращение двуногих. Что бы ни случилось, она останется верна идеям Зверизма, будет усердно работать, честно исполнять возложенные на нее обязанности и признавать руководящую роль Наполеона. Однако не за это они боролись, не на это уповали, не ради этого трудились. Не ради этого они строили мельницу и шли под пули Джонса. Таковы были ее мысли, хотя слов, чтобы их выразить, ей не хватало.

Наконец, чувствуя, что песня может заменить недостающие слова, она затянула "Всех животных Британии". Животные, сидевшие вокруг, подхватили песню. Они спели ее три раза подряд, очень мелодично, но тихо и печально, как никогда не пели раньше.

Едва они допели ее в третий раз, как появился Визгун, и по всему его виду было ясно, что у него есть какое-то важное сообщение. Визгуна сопровождали два пса.

- Особым постановлением товарища Наполеона, - объявил Визгун, - песня "Все животные Британии" отменяется. Петь ее отныне запрещено.

Животные были ошарашены.

- Но почему? - спросила Мюриель.

- В ней больше нет необходимости, товарищи, - сказал Визгун непререкаемым тоном. - "Все животные Британии" - это песня Восстания. Но Восстание закончилось. Сегодняшняя казнь предателей была заключительным актом Восстания. Наши внешние и внутренние враги разгромлены. В "Животных Британии" мы выражали наши чаяния на более справедливый общественный строй. Но такой строй теперь создан. Очевидно, что петь старый гимн уже нецелесообразно.

И хотя все были напуганы, кое-кто, может быть, и решился бы запротестовать, но тут овцы принялись за свое излюбленное "Четыре - хорошо, две - плохо". Блеянье овец длилось несколько минут и сделало продолжение дискуссии невозможным.

Устаревший гимн больше никогда не пели. Поэт Минимус сложил новую песню, которая начиналась словами:

О, Ферма Зверская! Я никогда

Не причиню тебе вреда!

И каждое воскресное утро эту песню пели теперь после торжественного подъема флага. Но ни слова, ни мелодия ее, по всеобщему мнению, не шли ни в какое сравнение со "Всеми животными Британии".

Глава восьмая

Через несколько дней, когда страх, вызванный казнями, поутих, кое-кто из животных припомнил или подумал, будто припомнил, что Шестая Заповедь гласит: "Да не убьет зверь другого зверя". Многим стало казаться, что имевшая место расправа противоречит закону, хотя в присутствии свиней или псов об этом никто говорить не решался. Кашка попросила Бенджамина прочесть ей Шестую Заповедь, а когда осел по обыкновению ответил, что в такие дела не впутывается, она обратилось к Мюриель. Коза прочла Заповедь вслух. Текст ее гласил: "Да не убьет зверь другого зверя БЕЗ ВИНЫ".

Как-то так получилось, что эти последние два слова ни у кого не удержались в памяти. Зато теперь все встало на свои места. Тяжкие вины истребленных предателей, вступивших в преступный сговор со Снежком, были очевидны.

Весь этот год обитатели фермы работали еще больше, чем в прошлом году. Нужно было восстановить мельницу, вдвое увеличив толщину ее стен, причем закончить ее строительство в запланированный срок, не забрасывая обычных полевых работ, - все это требовало огромных усилий. Временами животным казалось, что они работают больше, а едят не лучше, чем при Джонсе. Каждое воскресное утро Визгун, придерживая ножкой длинный лист бумаги, зачитывал им колонки цифр, согласно которым производство каждого вида продовольственных культур возросло на 200, 300, а то и 500 процентов. У животных не было причин ему не верить, тем более что они уже не так отчетливо помнили, каковы были условия их жизни ДО Восстания. Но все же бывали дни, когда они чувствовали, что предпочли бы цифр получать поменьше, а еды побольше.

Все приказания теперь передавались через Визгуна или кого-нибудь еще из руководящих свиней. Сам Наполеон не показывался на публике чаще чем раз в две недели. Когда он появлялся, его сопровождала не только свита из псов, но еще и черный петух, который вышагивал перед ним и, играя роль трубача-герольда, издавал громкое "кук-кар-ре-ку!" перед каждым выступлением Наполеона. Говорили, что даже в доме Наполеон поселился в отдельных покоях. Он принимал пищу в одиночестве, а два пса прислуживали ему, и ел он всегда из обеденного сервиза фирмы "Краун Дарби", который хранился в гостиной в стеклянном буфете. Было объявлено, что в день рождения Наполеона, так же как в дни других праздников, будет производиться салют из ружья.

О Наполеоне теперь никогда не говорили просто "Наполеон". Имя его теперь всегда произносилось по установленной формуле: "Наш Вождь, товарищ Наполеон". Свиньям нравилось придумывать для него титулы вроде "Отец Всех Животных", "Ужас Человечества", "Покровитель Овчарен", "Друг Утят" и т.п. В своих выступлениях Визгун со слезами на глазах говорил о мудрости Наполеона, доброте его сердца и горячей любви, которую он питает ко всем зверям всего мира, а в особенности к несчастным животным, которые еще страдают под игом рабства и невежества на других фермах. Вошло в обычай восхвалять Наполеона за всякое достижение и всякий успех. Часто можно было услышать, как одна квочка говорит другой: "Под мудрым руководством нашего Вождя, Товарища Наполеона, я снесла за шесть дней пять яиц", или как переговариваются две телки, смакуя воду из лужицы: "Как вкусна эта вода, хвала товарищу Наполеону!".

Общие чувства обитателей фермы выразил Минимус в стихотворении под названием "Наш Отец Наполеон", которое звучало так:

О владыка всех сердец,

Друг сирот и наш Отец,

Твои очи ярче светят, чем неон!

Я пьянею без вина,

Ты и солнце, и луна,

Ты и лето и весна,

Наш Отец Наполеон!

Все, что любим, чем живем,

Все, что мы едим и пьем,

И свободу - кто же дал нам, как не он!

Его имя мой язык

Славит всякий час и миг,

Как он светел и велик,

Наш Отец Наполеон!

Мы растим тебе щенят,

Поросят и жеребят,

Их мы учим - до скончания времен

Тебе преданными быть,

Одного тебя любить,

И врагов твоих губить,

Наш Отец Наполеон!

Наполеон одобрил эти стихи и повелел начертать их на стене большого гумна, противоположной Семи Заповедям. Они были увенчаны портретом Наполеона в профиль, который Визгун искусно нарисовал белилами.

Тем временем Наполеон вел через Вимпера сложные переговоры с Фредериком и Пилькингтоном. Груда бревен все еще не была продана. Фредерик больше Пилькингтона был заинтересован в приобретении бревен, но, судя по всему, не хотел давать настоящей цены. В это же самое время возобновились слухи, что Фредерик и его люди готовят нападение на Зверскую Ферму, а мельницу, строительство которой возбуждало у него бешеную зависть, замышляет сровнять с землей. Стало известно, что Снежок все еще скрывается на ферме Пинчфильд. В середине лета животных взбудоражило новое событие. Выступив с добровольным покаянием, три курицы публично признали себя виновными в том, что по заданию Снежка готовили покушение на Наполеона. Их немедленно казнили, а для безопасности Наполеона были приняты новые меры предосторожности. Его постель по ночам теперь охраняло четверо псов, по одному в каждом углу его апартаментов, а маленькому поросенку по клички Пинки было поручено пробовать все что ел Наполеон.

Примерно тогда же было объявлено, что Наполеон договорился о продаже штабеля бревен Пилькингтону. Готовилось также соглашение об обмене определенными видами продукции между Зверской Фермой и Фоксвудом на постоянной основе. Отношения Наполеона и Пилькингтона, хотя они по-прежнему велись через Вимпера, стали почти дружескими. Животные не доверяли Пилькингтону как существу человеческой породы, но во многих отношениях были готовы предпочесть его мистеру Фредерику, которого одновременно ненавидели и боялись. В течение всего лета, пока строительство мельницы близилось к завершению, слухи о нависшей угрозе вероломного нападения все усиливались и усиливались. Говорили, что Фредерик готовит отряд из 20 человек, вооруженных огнестрельным оружием, и что он уже подкупил должностных лиц и полицию, дабы те не задавали лишних вопросов, если он однажды станет обладателем документов, свидетельствующих о его праве собственности на Зверскую Ферму. Кроме того, из Пинчфильда доходили жуткие слухи о жестокостях, которые творил Фредерик над своими животными. Он забил до смерти старую лошадь, он морил голодом своих коров, он живьем бросил в печь свою собаку, он развлекался кровавыми петушиными боями, привязывая петухам обломки бритвенных лезвий на шпоры. У животных кровь вскипала от ярости, когда они узнавали о таких издевательствах над своими собратьями. Были предложения напасть всем скопом на ферму Пинчфильд, выбить оттуда людей и освободить угнетенных животных Фредерика. Визгун, однако, рекомендовал воздерживаться от опрометчивых решений и положиться во всем на мудрую стратегию Наполеона.

Озлобление против Фредерика, однако, продолжало расти. В одно воскресное утро Наполеон появился на гумне и заявил, что никогда в жизни и не помышлял о продаже бревен Фредерику. "Заключать какие-либо торговые сделки с подобным негодяем - ниже нашего достоинства", - сказал Наполеон. Голубям, которых все еще рассылали повсюду для пропаганды идеалов Восстания, запретили посещать Фоксвуд и велели сменить прежний лозунг "Смерть Человечеству!" на "Смерть Фредерику!".

В конце лета раскрылись новые козни Снежка. Посевы пшеницы заросли сорняками и, как оказалось, это Снежок во время одного из своих ночных визитов подсыпал плевел в семенное зерно. Один гусак, замешанный в этом заговоре, признался Визгуну в своем преступлении, после чего покончил с собой, наглотавшись ягод белены. Как теперь выяснилось, Снежок никогда не получал звания "Зверя-Героя" первой степени, как полагали прежде некоторые из животных. Эта легенда оказалась лживой, и распространил ее вскоре после Битвы у Коровника сам же Снежок. Он не только не был тогда награжден, но, наоборот, заклеймен позором за трусость, проявленную им в этой битве. Опять кое-кто выслушал эту новость с некоторым смущением, но вскоре Визгуну удалось убедить сомневавшихся.

Ценой великих усилий и изнурительных трудов мельница была, наконец, достроена почти одновременно с окончанием осенних уборочных работ. Механизмы еще предстояло поставить, и Вимпер вел переговоры об их приобретении, но само здание было готово. Вопреки всем трудностям, несмотря на отсутствие опыта, вопреки невезению и козням Снежка, мельница была сдана в назначенный день.

Усталые, но гордые собой животные бродили вокруг своего детища, которое казалось им даже прекраснее первой мельницы. Да и стены ее были вдвое толще. Разве что динамитом можно было сокрушить эти стены! И когда они вспоминали, сколько трудностей преодолели, когда думали, какие грандиозные перемены произойдут в их жизни, когда завертятся крылья ветряка и заработают динамо-машины, они, забыв об усталости, с ликующими криками принимались весело скакать вокруг мельницы. Сам Наполеон в сопровождении петуха и девяти псов, осмотрел объект и лично поздравил строителей с их достижениями. Он объявил, что мельнице присвоено название "Мельница имени Наполеона".

Спустя два дня все животные были созваны на чрезвычайный митинг. Сойдясь на гумне, они онемели от изумления, узнав, что Наполеон продал бревна Фредерику. Перевозка бревен была назначена на завтра, когда должны были прибыть телеги. В течение всего периода притворной дружбы с Пилькингтоном Наполеон, оказывается, был в тайном соглашении с Фредериком.

Все отношения с Фоксвудом были прерваны, а самому Пилькингтону было направлено оскорбительное послание. Голуби получили указание облетать ферму Пинчфильд стороной и поменять лозунг "Смерть Фредерику!" на "Смерть Пилькингтону!". Тогда же Наполеон заверил обитателей фермы, что слухи о готовящемся вторжении Фредерика не соответствуют действительности, а жестокость Фредерика в обращении со своими животными сильно преувеличена молвой. Возможно, эти россказни исходили от Снежка или его агентов. Оказалось, что Снежок прятался вовсе не в Пинчфильде, где он на самом деле не разу в жизни не был, а наоборот, все последние годы он был на содержании у Пилькингтона и в исключительной роскоши жил в Фоксвуде.

Свиньи приходили в экстаз от хитрости Наполеона. Оказывается он, демонстрируя дружбу с Пилькингтоном, принудил Фредерика поднять цену на бревна на 12 фунтов. Но высшее свидетельство гениальности Наполеона - это то, что он никому из людей по-настоящему не доверяет. Фредерик хотел дать за бревна какой-то "чек", то есть бумажку с обещанием выплатить обозначенную на этой бумажке сумму. Наполеон же оказался хитрее и потребовал уплаты вперед и наличными. Деньги уже получены, и их как раз хватит на покупку механизма для ветряной мельницы.

Бревна тем временем перевозились с большой поспешностью. А как только с ними покончили, на гумне было устроено торжественное собрание, чтобы главным образом полюбоваться на банкноты Фредерика. Нацепив ордена и блаженно улыбаясь, Наполеон возлежал на помосте в груде соломы, а деньги, аккуратно уложенные на взятом с кухни фарфоровом блюде, лежали рядом.

Звери гуськом медленно шествовали мимо блюда, и у каждого было время полюбоваться банкнотами. Боксер вытянул свой нос понюхать банкноты, и легкие белые листочки затрепетали и зашелестели от его дыхания.

А через три дня был большой переполох. Вимпер примчался на своем велосипеде, бледный, как смерть, бросил велосипед во дворе и кинулся прямо в дом. Еще через секунду яростный рев из покоев Наполеона потряс ферму. Новость облетела всех с невероятной быстротой. Банкноты были поддельные! Бревна достались Фредерику даром!

Наполеон созвал всех животных и страшным голосом провозгласил смертный приговор Фредерику. "Мы сварим его живьем, когда поймаем", - сказал он. Одновременно он заявил, что теперь следует ждать от Фредерика самого худшего. Фредерик и его люди в любой момент могут предпринять давно ожидаемое нападение. У всех подходов к ферме были выставлены посты. В Фоксвуд была отправлена четверка голубей с примирительным посланием, которое, как надеялись, поможет восстановить добрые отношения с Пилькингтоном.

Враг напал уже следующим утром. Звери завтракали, когда дозорные принесли весть, что Фредерик и его банда уже прошли через окованные железными скрепами ворота. Навстречу захватчикам была сделана доблестная вылазка, но в этот раз победа не далась животным так легко, как когда-то в Битве при Коровнике. У Фредерика было полтора десятка человек и полдюжины ружей. Люди открыли стрельбу с расстояния уже пятнадцати ярдов. Несмотря на усилия Наполеона и Боксера, животные, не выдержав пальбы и свиста картечи, обратились в бегство. Многие получили ранения. Они прятались в амбарах и сараях, откуда следили за врагом через щели и дырки от выпавших сучков. Весь большой выгон вместе с мельницей был в руках противника. На какое-то мгновение показалось, что даже Наполеон в затруднении. Он ходил в полном молчании взад и вперед, а хвост у него стоял торчком и подрагивал. То и дело он бросал тоскливые взгляды в сторону Фоксвуда. Если Пилькингтон и его люди придут на помощь, нападение можно будет отразить без труда. Как раз в эту минуту в воздухе показались голуби, отправленные в Фоксвуд накануне. Один из голубей нес листок бумаги. На нем карандашом были нацарапаны слова: "Поделом тебе, скотина!" Тем временем отряд Фредерика окружил мельницу. Тревожно перешептываясь, животные наблюдали за действиями людей. Один из них нес кувалду, другой - лом. Судя по всему, они собирались ломать мельницу.

- Смелее, товарищи звери! - раздался визг Наполеона. - Это невозможно! Стены мельницы несокрушимы! Им не разобрать их за неделю!

Бенджамин с вниманием следил за поведением людей. Двое ломом и кувалдой долбили отверстие в основании мельницы. Медленно и почти изумленно Бенджамин покачал своей длинной мордой.

- Я думаю так, - сказал он, - сейчас они забьют пороховой заряд в эту дырку. Видите, что они делают?

Животные испуганно молчали. Оставить укрытие они уже не могли. Еще через несколько минут двуногие врассыпную побежали от мельницы. Раздался оглушительный взрыв. Голуби взвились в воздух, а все звери, кроме Наполеона, упали на брюхо и попрятали свои морды. Когда они поднялись, огромное облако черного дыма висело там, где только что высились стены мельницы. Ветер сносил его в сторону. Мельницы не было!

Это зрелище вернуло животным отвагу. Их страх и отчаяние утонули в ярости и ненависти к этому подлому и презренному поступку! С кличем мести на устах, не ожидая ни от кого приказаний, всем скопом они ринулись прямо на врага. Теперь они уже не обращали внимания на беспощадную картечь, которая сыпалась на них градом. Это была дикая, жестокая битва. Люди палили снова и снова. А когда дошло до рукопашной схватки, - они лупили зверей палками и пинали тяжелыми сапогами. Корова, три овцы и два гуся пали смертью храбрых, и почти все получили ранения. Наполеон, руководивший боевыми действиями из глубокого тыла, тоже потерял кончик хвоста, который ему отстрелили картечиной. Но и люди понесли тяжелые потери. Трое двуногих один за другим с разбитой головой пали под копытами Боксера. Еще одного забодала корова. Джесси и Блюбель изодрали в клочья штаны другого. А когда девять псов личной охраны Наполеона, которым он приказал совершить обход под прикрытием изгороди, внезапно появились в тылу захватчиков, паника охватила их. Люди увидели, что им грозит окружение. Фредерик отдал приказ к отходу и в следующую минуту, пока дорога была еще свободна, трусливые враги обратились в бегство. Животные долго гнались за ними по полям и нанесли им еще несколько ударов рогами и копытами, когда люди Фредерика продирались сквозь изгородь.

Звери победили, но были измучены и истекали кровью. Медленно и невесело они поплелись назад. Вид распростертых в траве погибших товарищей поверг их в слезы. Минуту они постояли в грустном молчании на том месте, где когда-то была мельница. Да, от их трудов не осталось и следа! Даже фундамент был частично уничтожен. Восстанавливая мельницу, они не смогли бы, как в прошлый раз, использовать упавшие камни. Силой взрыва их разбросало на сотни ярдов вокруг. Как будто мельницы здесь и вовсе никогда не было.

Когда они подошли к усадьбе, Визгун, который по необъяснимым причинам отсутствовал на поле боя, подбежал к ним, припрыгивая, размахивая хвостиком и сияя от радости. Торжественный выстрел из ружья донесся со двора.

- Что это за стрельба? - удивился Боксер.

- Это салют в честь нашей Победы! - выкрикнул Визгун.

- Какой победы? - спросил Боксер. Колени у него кровоточили, он потерял подкову, разбил копыто, и целая дюжина картечин засела у него в задней ноге.

- Как какая Победа, товарищ? Разве мы не изгнали врага с нашей земли со Священной земли Зверской Фермы?

- Но они же взорвали мельницу! А мы строили ее два года!

- Ну и что? Мы построим другую мельницу! Мы построим, если будет нужно, шесть мельниц! Ты, товарищ зверь, недооцениваешь значение совершенного нами подвига. Враг стоял вот здесь, на том самом месте, где мы сейчас стоим, но под руководством товарища Наполеона - мы не оставили ему ни пяди нашей земли!

- Мы отбили лишь то, чем владели и раньше! - сказал Боксер.

- В этом и состоит наша победа! - сказал Визгун.

Звери приплелись во двор. Картечь, засевшая под шкурой Боксера, причиняла ему жгучую боль. Боксер уже представлял в своем воображении тяжкие труды по восстановлению мельницы и мысленно укреплял себя для этой задачи. Но впервые ему пришло в голову, что ему уже 11 лет, и силы его, пожалуй, уже не те, что прежде.

Но когда животные увидели, что зеленый флаг снова развевается на флагштоке, и опять услышали выстрел из ружья (а всего было сделано семь выстрелов), когда прослушали речь Наполеона, который восславил их героизм, они уверились, что в самом деле одержали великую победу. Звери, павшие в бою, были преданы торжественному погребению. Боксер и Кашка тянули превращенную в катафалк телегу, а сам Наполеон вышагивал во главе процессии. Целых два дня были посвящены торжествам. Пели песни, снова салютовали из ружья, каждое животное получило в качестве особой награды в подарок по яблоку, каждой птице выдали по три унции зерна, а каждой собаке - по три сухарика. Было объявлено, что сражение будет называться "Битвой за Мельницу". Наполеон учредил новую награду, "Орден Зеленого Знамени", первым кавалером которого провозгласил самого себя. Среди всеобщего веселья была позабыта злополучная история с поддельными банкнотами.

Как раз через несколько дней после победы свиньи натолкнулись в подвалах жилого дома на ящик виски. Они его проглядели в те дни, когда впервые заняли дом. Вечером из дома понеслись звуки громких песен, среди которых, ко всеобщему удивлению, можно было различить и отдельные строчки "Всех Животных Британии". Около половины десятого все отчетливо видели, как Наполеон в старом котелке мистера Джонса на голове выскочил из двери черного хода, стремительно прогалопировал вокруг двора и вновь исчез в дверях дома.

А утром в доме воцарилась глубокая тишина. Ни одна свинья, похоже, не могла даже шевельнуться. Только около девяти Визгун, ковыляя медленно и с удрученным видом, совершил первый выход. Глаза его потускнели, хвостик безвольно повис сзади, весь вид его свидетельствовал о тяжелой болезни. Он созвал животных и сообщил им ужасную весть. Вождь был при смерти!

Раздались рыдания. У дома постелили солому, и все животные ходили мимо дверей только на цыпочках. Они спрашивали друг у друга со слезами на глазах, как же им теперь жить без Наполеона? Прошел слух, что Снежку все-таки удалось подсыпать яду в его тарелку. В одиннадцать часов Визгун вышел сделать еще одно объявление. В качестве своей последней воли Товарищ Наполеон издал торжественный декрет: употребление спиртных напитков отныне карается смертью!

К вечеру, однако, Наполеону полегчало, а на следующее утро Визгун уже смог сказать им, что Вождь поправляется. К вечеру того же дня Наполеон вновь приступил к работе, а уже на другой день поручил Вимперу закупить несколько популярных брошюр о пивоварении и перегонке спирта. Через неделю Наполеон повелел перепахать небольшую лужайку за садом, которую первоначально предполагалось зарезервировать для животных, достигших пенсионного возраста. Сначала объявили, что это пастбище истощено и нуждается в пересеве, но вскоре стало известно, что Наполеон намерен занять этот участок земли под ячмень.

В один из этих дней случилось странное происшествие, смысл которого едва ли кто был способен понять. Как-то в полночь со двора послышался ужасный грохот, и все животные повыскакивали из своих стойл и сараев. Ночь была лунная. Под торцевой стенкой большого гумна, на которой были начертаны Семь Заповедей, валялась разломанная надвое приставная мельница. Оглушенный падением Визгун лежал рядом с ней пластом, тут же валялись фонарик, малярная кисть и опрокинутое ведро, из которого по земле растекалась белая краска. Псы вмиг окружили Визгуна и, как только он очнулся и смог подняться на ноги, сопроводили его в дом. Животные терялись в догадках, что бы все это значило. Никто ничего не понимал, за исключением старого Бенджамина, который кивал своей головой с умным видом и, казалось, все понял, но по обыкновению решил промолчать.

А несколько дней спустя Мюриель, перечитывая для себя Семь Заповедей, обнаружила, что еще одну заповедь животные запомнили неточно. Они думали, что в Пятой Заповеди сказано "Зверь не пьет спиртное", а там оказалось еще три слова, о которых все почему-то забыли. Заповедь гласила: "Зверь не пьет спиртное НЕ В МЕРУ".

Глава девятая

Разбитое копыто Боксера заживало медленно. Мельницу стали восстанавливать уже на следующий день после окончания победных торжеств. Боксер не взял освобождения от работ ни на один день. Он старался не показывать вида, что страдает от болей в ноге. По вечерам, правда, он признавался Кашке, что копыто его несколько беспокоит. Кашка делала ему припарки из жеваной травы и вместе с Бенджамином уговаривала Боксера работать не надрываясь. "И лошадиные легкие не вечны", - говорила она ему. Но Боксер не слушал. "У меня только одна цель, - говорил он, - еще до ухода на пенсию убедиться в том, что строительство близко к завершению".

Еще когда принимали трудовое законодательство Зверской Фермы, было решено, что свиньи и лошади выходят на пенсию в возрасте двенадцати лет, коровы - в четырнадцать лет, собаки - в девять лет, овцы - в семь, а куры и гуси в пять лет. Всем были обещаны щедрые пенсии. Хотя никто на ферме пенсионного возраста еще не достиг, говорили об этом в последнее время много. Теперь, так как поляну за садом отвели под ячмень, пошли слухи, что скоро участок большого выгона будет отгорожен и превращен в специальное пастбище для пенсионеров. Для лошадей пенсия была определена в свое время в размере 5 фунтов зерна в день летом и 15 фунтов сена зимой. По общественным праздникам предполагалось выдавать еще и морковку или, может быть, яблоко. Боксеру исполнялось 12 лет в августе следующего года.

Между тем, жилось на ферме нелегко. Зима оказалась такой же суровой, как и в прошлом году, а пищи было еще меньше. Для всех, кроме свиней и псов, пришлось еще раз сократить продовольственную пайку. "Уравниловка, - объяснил Визгун, - противоречит принципам Зверизма". Он доказывал без труда, что, хотя так и может кому-то иногда показаться, но в действительности никакой продовольственной проблемы на ферме не существует. Конечно, ситуация в текущий момент вынудила произвести пересмотр продовольственных норм (Визгун всегда говорил не "сокращение", а именно "пересмотр"), но в сравнении с временами Джонса общее улучшение питания животных - огромное. Он зачитывал цифры пронзительной скороговоркой, детально показывая, что они теперь получают больше овса, больше сена, больше кормовой свеклы, чем во времена Джонса, что питьевая вода у них теперь гораздо лучшего качества, рабочий день короче, продолжительность жизни увеличилась, а детская смертность сократилась, что соломы в стойлах стало больше, а мух меньше. Животные ему верили. Сказать по правде, все, что было при Джонсе, почти полностью выветрилось из их памяти. Они сознавали, что теперешняя жизнь тяжка и сурова, что они часто голодают и часто мерзнут и от работы свободны разве что во сне. Но, конечно же, раньше было еще хуже. В это они охотно верили. А главное, раньше они были подневольной скотиной, а теперь - свободные звери. В этом принципиальная разница, все время подчеркивал Визгун.

Ртов на ферме прибавилось. Осенью четыре свиноматки опоросились почти одновременно, родив общим счетом тридцать одного поросенка. Все они были пегими и вычислить их происхождение было нетрудно - Наполеон оставался единственным нехолощенным кабаном на ферме. Впоследствии, как только появятся кирпичи и бревна, предполагалась построить в саду школу. Пока же Наполеон лично руководил воспитанием поросят на кухне. Поросята занимались спортивными упражнениями в саду, и им не рекомендовалось играть с другими несовершеннолетними животными. Примерно тогда же было установлено правило, что когда свинья встречается на тропинке с каким-нибудь другим зверем, последний должен посторониться и уступить дорогу, а также, что все свиньи любого звания имеют исключительное право носить зеленый бантик на хвосте по воскресеньям.

Сезон завершили сравнительно успешно, но денег все равно не хватало. Предстояло закупить песок, кирпич и известку для строительства школы, к тому же опять надо было копить средства на мельничный механизм. А кроме того, были нужны свечи и керосин для дома и сахар на стол Наполеону (другим свиньям Наполеон запретил есть сахар, заботясь о том, как бы они не ожирели). Требовалось пополнить таявшие запасы гвоздей, шпагата, угля, проволоки, заплат, собачьих сухарей, различных инструментов, пришлось продать стог сена и часть урожая картофеля, а поставки яиц на рынок увеличить до шести сотен в неделю, так что цыплят куры высиживали совсем немного, только чтобы поддержать поголовье на прежнем уровне. Кормовой рацион, урезанный в декабре, в феврале сократили вторично и в целях экономии было запрещено зажигать керосиновые лампы в стойлах. Но свиньи не были похожи на голодающих и даже прибавляли в весе. Как-то в конце февраля после полудня, теплый, сильный, аппетитный запах, неслыханный никогда ранее, разнесся по двору из заброшенной еще при Джонсе пивоварни. Кто-то сказал, что очень похоже пахнет вареный ячмень. Животные жадно втягивали в себя воздух и гадали: не им ли на ужин готовится это варево? Но никакого варева они, во всяком случае, не получили, а в следующее воскресенье вышел указ, согласно которому весь ячмень отныне будет поступать в распоряжение свиней. Полянка за фруктовым садом уже была засеяна. А вскоре поползли слухи, что в ежедневный рацион каждой свиньи входит теперь пинта пива. Сам Наполеон получал полгаллона пива в день, которое ему всегда подавали в супнице фирмы "Краун Дерби".

Лишения, которые приходилось нести, хотя бы отчасти сглаживались тем, что жизнь стала теперь торжественнее и красивее. Было больше песен, речей, шествий. Наполеон решил проводить раз в неделю Стихийную Демонстрацию в память о победах и сражениях Зверской Фермы. В назначенное время все животные, оставив работу, должны были в воинском строе и маршевым шагом делать круг почета вдоль всех границ фермы. Во главе процессии шли свиньи, следом за ними лошади, потом коровы, овцы и домашняя птица. Псы бежали по бокам, а черный петух Наполеона вышагивал впереди колонны демонстрантов. Боксер и Кашка всегда носили зеленое знамя с копытом и рогом, украшенное лозунгом "Да здравствует товарищ Наполеон!". После демонстрации декламировали сложенные в честь Наполеона стихи, Визгун делал доклад, в коем знакомил животных с деталями последних достижений в области производства продуктов питания, а иногда палили из ружья. Овцы были величайшими энтузиастами Стихийных Демонстраций. Если кто-то ворчал (такое случалось, когда свиней и псов не было рядом), что они зря теряют время на глупости, выстаивая на холоде часами, овцы непременно прерывали ворчание единодушным блеянием: "Четыре - хорошо, два - плохо!". Но в общем, эти торжества доставляли животным радость. Ведь они напоминали им, что, в конце концов, они и вправду - свободные звери и работают только на себя, и это служило им утешением. Песни и шествия, цифровые сводки Визгуна, ружейная пальба, петушиные клики и колыхание знамен помогали им забывать о пустом брюхе хотя бы ненадолго.

В апреле Зверская Ферма была провозглашена Республикой, и возникла необходимость избрать Президента. Кандидатура Наполеона получила всенародное одобрение, и его избрание произошло единодушно. В тот же день Визгун сообщил, что открылись новые документы, которые содержат ранее неизвестные подробности о предательстве Снежка. Снежок не просто пытался, как прежде полагали, изменнически проиграть Битву при Коровнике, но и открыто выступал на стороне Джонса. Это именно он возглавил действия двуногих и бросился на зверей с кличем "Да здравствует Человечество!" на устах. Раны на спине Снежка, о которых кое-кто из животных еще помнил, были следами клыков Наполеона.

В середине лета, после нескольких лет отсутствия, на ферму неожиданно вернулся ворон Моисей. Он совершенно не изменился, по-прежнему бездельничал и рассказывал теми же словами, что и раньше, свои небылицы про Леденцовые Горы. Он взлетал на вершину дерева, хлопая черными крыльями, и часами проповедовал всем, кто был расположен его слушать. "Там, высоко в небе, за облаками, находятся Леденцовые Горы", - торжественно каркал он, указывая вверх большим клювом, - блаженная страна, где мы, несчастные животные, можем освободиться от наших тяжелых трудов!". Он даже утверждал, что как-то долетел туда и увидел вечно зеленые поля клевера, льняные жмыхи и куски колотого сахара, которые растут прямо на заборах. Многие животные ему верили. Их жизнь, считали они, была голодной и трудной, и разве не было бы справедливо, если бы где-то существовал лучший мир? Трудно было определить, как к Моисею относились свиньи. Все они презрительно отвергали рассказы о Леденцовых Горах как плоды его воображения, и все же разрешали ему оставаться на ферме, не работая, и даже определили ему четверть пинты пива в день.

Как только копыто у Боксера зажило, он налег на работу еще ретивее. В этом году, правда, все животные трудились как проклятые. В дополнение к повседневным полевым работам и восстановлению мельницы нужно было еще строить начатую в марте школу для поросят. На пустой желудок трудно было выдерживать долгий рабочий день, но Боксер был непоколебим. Ни в том, что он говорил, ни в том, что делал, не было никаких признаков упадка сил. Только внешность Боксера, пожалуй, изменилась: шерсть не лоснилась больше, а тощие ноги как будто усохли. Некоторые животные уверяли, что Боксер поправится, как только появится зеленая травка, но вот пришла весна, а Боксеру нисколько не полегчало.

Иной раз, когда напряжением всех своих сил Боксер придерживал какой-нибудь огромный валун, скользящий по склону каменного барьера, казалось, что он держится на ногах только усилием воли. Можно было увидеть, как губы его складываются в слова: "Я буду работать еще упорней!" - голоса у него уже не оставалось. Снова и снова Кашка и Бенджамин умоляли его поберечь здоровье, но он их не слушал. Приближался день, когда ему должно было исполниться 12 лет. Боксер был готов на что угодно, лишь бы до выхода на пенсию набрать достаточный запас камня для мельницы.

Однажды в поздний летний вечер внезапный слух пронесся по ферме: с Боксером, который ушел ворочать камни в одиночку, что-то случилось. Слух оказался верен. Еще через несколько минут два голубя, обгоняя друг друга, примчались с вестью: Боксер упал! Он лежит на боку и не может подняться!

Чуть не половина всех животных фермы понеслась на пригорок к мельнице. Боксер лежал между оглоблями телеги, вытянув шею. Глаза его потускнели, а бока покрылись испариной. Тонкий ручеек крови струился изо рта. Кашка опустилась рядом на колени.

- Боксер! - сказала она. - Что с тобой?

- Легкие, - сказал Боксер едва слышно. - Но это не важно. Я думаю, теперь вы справитесь и без меня. Камней мы заготовили прилично. А мне все равно оставался до пенсии только один месяц. Сказать по правде, я уже с нетерпением ждал ее. Может быть, и Бенджамина, который тоже стар, отпустят вскоре на покой, и он составит мне компанию...

- Нужно немедленно послать за помощью, - сказала Кашка. - Пусть кто-нибудь сбегает и известит Визгуна.

Все помчались назад в усадьбу. Остались только Кашка и Бенджамин, который лег рядом с Боксером и, ничего не говоря, стал отгонять от него мух своим длинным хвостом. Через четверть часа пришел Визгун, всем своим видом выражая огорчение и сочувствие, и сказал, что товарищ Наполеон как величайшее несчастье воспринял это печальное происшествие с одним из самых верных тружеников фермы. Он уже готовит все необходимое для отправки Боксера в Виллингдонскую больницу. Животные почувствовали беспокойство. Никто еще, кроме Снежка и Молли, никогда не покидал ферму, и мысль о том, что их товарищ окажется в руках двуногих, им не нравилась. Визгун, однако, с легкостью доказал, что хирург-ветеринар в Виллингдоне вылечит Боксера успешнее, чем это можно сделать в условиях фермы. Где-то через полчаса Боксер несколько оправился и, хотя и с трудом, смог дотащиться до своего стойла, где Кашка с Бенджамином соорудили для него мягкую постель из соломы.

Следующие два дня Боксер отлеживался у себя в стойле. Свиньи вынесли ему из ванной комнаты в доме большую бутыль розового снадобья, которое им попалось в аптечном сундуке, и Кашка давала его Боксеру два раза в день после еды. Вечера она проводила в стойле, разговаривая с ним, а Бенджамин отгонял мух. Боксер признавался, что не жалеет о случившемся. После полного выздоровления он надеялся прожить еще года три и уже предвкушал эти спокойные дни, которые он проведет на отгороженном пастбище для ветеранов. Впервые у него появится досуг для самообразования. Боксер говорил, что все свое свободное время посвятит изучению алфавита.

Но Бенджамин и Кашка могли быть с Боксером только по вечерам, а фургон приехал за Боксером в середине дня. Под надзором свиней свободные звери занимались прополкой репы, когда вдруг показался Бенджамин, который несся вскачь со стороны усадьбы и орал во всю свою ослиную глотку. Впервые они видели его в таком волнении, да и как Бенджамин скачет галопом, тоже раньше никому видеть не приходилось.

- Скорее! Скорее! - кричал он. - Боксера забирают!

Не дожидаясь никаких приказаний от свиней, животные бросили работу и понеслись в усадьбу. Во дворе, действительно, стоял крытый фургон, запряженный двумя лошадьми, с надписью на боку. На кучерском месте сидел сомнительной наружности человек в котелке, надвинутом на глаза. В стойле Боксера никого не было.

Животные гурьбой окружили фургон. "До свидания, Боксер! - хором кричали они. - Выздоравливай!"

- Идиоты! - заорал Бенджамин. - Идиоты! - Он носился вокруг фургона и вставал от волнения на дыбы. - Вы что, не видите, что там написано на боку этого фургона?

Животные пришли в замешательство и смолкли. Мюриель принялась было читать по слогам, но Бенджамин отпихнул ее и средь мертвой тишины выкрикнул: "Альфред Симонс. Виллингдон. Убой лошадей и варка клея. Торговля шкурами и костяной мукой. Поставка мяса на псарни".

- Вы понимаете, что это значит? Боксера везут на живодерню!

Раздались крики ужаса. Но в этот миг человек на козлах хлестнул своих лошадей, и фургон выкатил со двора. Все выбежали вслед за фургоном, крича что было сил. Кашка бежала впереди всех. Фургон набирал скорость. Силясь пуститься вскачь на негнущихся ногах, Кашка с трудом перешла на неровный галоп. "Боксер, - ржала она, - Боксер! Боксер! Боксер!"

В эту минуту Боксер как будто услышал шум снаружи, и морда его с белой полоской появилась в маленьком заднем окошечке фургона.

- Боксер! - ржала Кашка в отчаянии. - Боксер! Прыгай! Прыгай скорее! Они везут тебя на смерть!

- Прыгай, Боксер, прыгай! - подхватили остальные, но набиравший скорость фургон уже уносился от них. Было даже неясно, дошел ли до Боксера смысл слов Кашки. Но тут вдруг его морда в окошке исчезла, а из фургона послышались звуки барабанящих в стены копыт. Видимо, он пытался пробиться на волю. В былые времена Боксеру хватило бы двух ударов копытами, чтобы разнести фургон в щепки. Но, увы, силы уже оставили его. Звуки ударов ослабли, а еще через несколько секунд стихли совсем. В отчаянии животные стали взывать к уносившим фургон лошадям. "Товарищи звери! Товарищи! Остановитесь! Не губите Боксера! Он ваш брат!". Но две глупые и невежественные скотины даже не понимали, о чем это им кричат, только поводили ушами и все ускоряли бег. Морда Боксера больше не показывалась в окошке. Кто-то все-таки догадался, что надо обогнать фургон и захлопнуть окованные железными скрепами ворота, но было уже поздно. Через минуту фургон миновал их и быстро исчез на дороге внизу.

Боксера никто больше не видел никогда. Через три дня было объявлено, что он скончался в Виллингдонской больнице, окруженный наивысшим вниманием и заботой, какие когда-либо выпадали на долю лошади. Новость принес Визгун, уверявший, что присутствовал при последних часах жизни Боксера.

- Я в жизни не видел более трогательного зрелища, - хрюкал Визгун, смахивая слезу. Я был с ним до самой его кончины. И уже перед смертью, уже теряя голос, он прошептал мне на ухо: "Единственное, о чем я сожалею, что мельница еще не достроена! Вперед, товарищи! - прошептал он мне. - Вперед к победе Зверизма! Да здравствует Зверская Ферма, да здравствует товарищ Наполеон! Наполеон всегда прав!" - таковы были его последние слова, товарищи!

Вдруг весь облик Визгуна переменился. Он на мгновение смолк, его маленькие глазки подозрительно пометались в одну сторону, в другую - и он продолжил:

- Нам стало известно, - сказал он, - что когда Боксера увезли, кто-то распустил неумный и вредный клеветнический слух, порочащий нашу ферму. На фургоне будто бы заметили надпись "Убой лошадей" и вообразили, что Боксера увозят на живодерню. Кто мог придумать эту глупость? Я уверен, что вы лучшего мнения о нашем любимом вожде, товарище Наполеоне, - вопил Визгун возмущенно, дергая животиком и прыгая из стороны в сторону. - А все это очень просто объяснить, товарищи! Раньше фургон принадлежал живодеру, который продал его ветеринару-хирургу, а тот еще не замазал старую надпись. Вот так возникла эта ошибка.

Животные выслушали его с большим облегчением. А когда Визгун пустился в описания дальнейших подробностей мужественного поведения Боксера на смертном одре, забот, которыми он был окружен, дорогостоящих лекарств, невзирая на цены заказанных для него Наполеоном, последние сомнения отпали. Боксер, по крайней мере, умер счастливым; эта мысль смягчала им горечь утраты.

В следующее воскресное утро Наполеон сам появился на собрании и произнес краткую памятную речь о Боксере. Вернуть останки Боксера для погребения на ферме, как оказалось, не было возможности. Но он, Наполеон, велел сделать большой венок из лавра, растущего в саду, и послать его на могилу Боксера. "А еще через несколько дней, - сказал Наполеон, - свиньи устроят Боксеру торжественные поминки". Наполеон закончил свою речь напоминанием о двух знаменитых изречениях Боксера: "Я буду работать еще упорней" и "Товарищ Наполеон всегда прав". "Эти замечательные изречения не мешало бы накрепко усвоить всем на ферме", - сказал он.

В день, назначенный для поминок, из Виллингдона прикатил фургон бакалейщика и доставил на ферму большой деревянный ящик. Весь вечер из дома доносились звуки шумных песен, пение потом перешло во что-то, очень похожее на неистовую перебранку, а окончилось все после одиннадцати часов ужасным грохотом разбитых стекол. До полудня в доме не шелохнулась ни единая душа. На ферме догадались, что свиньи, наверное, опять раздобыли где-то денег на ящик виски.

Глава десятая

Прошло несколько лет. Уходили год за годом, а с ними проносилась и краткая жизнь животных. Настало время, когда никто на ферме не помнил прежних дней до Восстания - кроме кобылы Кашки, осла Бенджамина, ворона Моисея и нескольких свиней.

Скончалась коза Мюриель. Расстались с жизнью старые псы Блюбель, Джесси и Пинчер. Давно не было в живых фермера мистера Джонса, он умер в больнице для алкоголиков на другом конце страны. Снежок был забыт совершенно. И Боксера позабыли все, кроме тех, кто когда-то дружил с ним. Кашка сильно погрузнела и одряхлела, ноги у нее не гнулись в суставах, а глаза слезились. Прошло уже два года с тех пор, как она достигла пенсионного возраста, но еще никто на ферме до сих пор не был отпущен на покой. Толки о выделении для престарелых ветеранов специального уголка на пастбище давно заглохли. Наполеон стал матерым кабаном весом в полтора центнера. Визгун так разжирел, что едва разнимал заплывшие салом веки. Только старый Бенджамин почти не изменился, разве что морда поседела да со времени смерти Боксера он стал еще более замкнут и угрюм.

Число обитателей фермы теперь порядком возросло, хотя и не в такой значительной степени, как когда-то предполагали. Для родившихся на ферме животных Восстание было лишь туманным преданием, известным с чужих слов. Те же, кого ферма купила в последние годы, и вовсе до своего появления здесь не слыхали ни о чем подобном. На ферме трудились три новые лошади, помимо Кашки - красивые и сильные, хорошие работяги и добрые товарищи, но уж очень глупые. В изучении алфавита ни одна из них не могла продвинуться дальше буквы "Б". Главным образом, со слов Кашки, к которой они питали почти дочернее почтение, они затвердили все, что им рассказали о Восстании и принципах Зверизма, но вряд ли многое поняли из сказанного.

Ферма стала теперь успешным предприятием и улучшила свою организацию она даже расширилась за счет двух соседних полей, купленных у мистера Пилькингтона. Ветряная мельница была в конце концов благополучно достроена, на ферме была теперь своя собственная молотилка и сеноэлеватор, прибавилось несколько новых хозяйственных построек. Вимпер приобрел себе высокий двухколесный экипаж.

Ветряная мельница, правда, электроэнергию не вырабатывала. На ней мололи кукурузу и получали с этого неплохой доход. Строилась другая мельница, и говорили, что когда ее достроят, на ней-то все-таки будет установлена динамо-машина. Но об изобилии, о котором когда-то учил животных мечтать Снежок - о стойлах с электрическим освещением, водопроводом с горячей и холодной водой, о трехдневной рабочей неделе, - больше не поминали. Наполеон отверг эти идеи как противоречащие духу Зверизма. "Истинное счастье, - говорил он, - состоит в усердном труде и скромной жизни".

Как-то так вышло, что ферма разбогатела, нисколько не сделав счастливее самих животных, - за исключением, конечно, свиней и псов. Может быть, так получилось, отчасти оттого, что свиней и псов развелось слишком много. Не то чтоб эти создания сидели без дела. Как не уставал разъяснять Визгун, организация, учет и контроль не оставляли свиньям ни минуты покоя. Значительная доля этих забот была такого рода, что прочие животные, по своему невежеству, ничего в них не понимали, и поэтому сами не могли принять в них участие. К примеру, Визгун говорил, что свиньи ежедневно вынуждены затрачивать неимоверные усилия на загадочные "планы" и "отчеты", "сводки", "протоколы" и "докладные". Они представляли собой большие листы бумаги, которые необходимо было исписать как можно гуще, после чего их обычно сжигали в печи. Визгун говорил, что эта работа имеет чрезвычайное значение для благосостояния фермы. Возможно, что так оно и было, но, во всяком случае, никакой пищи своим собственным трудом ни свиньи, ни псы не производили, а их было много, а отсутствием аппетита они никогда не страдали.

Что касается остальных, то жизнь их шла как всегда. Обыкновенно они терпели муки голода, спали на соломе, пили воду из луж, трудились в поле, зимой страдали от стужи, летом от мух. Иногда те, кто постарше, напрягали свою слабую память и пытались разобраться, как они жили в первые дни после Восстания, сразу после изгнания Джонса - лучше или хуже, чем теперь. Но из этих попыток ничего не выходило. Им не с чем было сравнивать свое теперешнее житье, не с чем было иметь дело, кроме сводок Визгуна, которые неизменно свидетельствовали: жизнь становится все лучше и лучше. Животные сошлись на том, что этот вопрос неразрешим, да и времени думать над такими вещами у них было немного. Только старый Бенджамин был уверен, что помнит каждый самый незначительный эпизод в своей долгой жизни и знает, что никогда не было - да и не могло быть - как-то особенно лучше или хуже. "Голод, лишения и разочарования, - говорил он, - это неизменный закон жизни".

И все-таки животные никогда не расставались с надеждой. Мало того, они гордились тем, что являются гражданами Зверской Фермы, сознавая это своей привилегией, и ни на миг не теряли этого сознания. Они были единственной фермой в стране - во всей Англии! - которая принадлежала животным и которой управляли сами животные. Даже самые младшие, даже новички, купленные фермой за тридевять земель, не переставали восхищаться этим. И когда они слышали праздничный салют, видели, как развевается зеленый флаг на флагштоке, сердца их переполнялись неизбывной гордостью, и они пускались в воспоминания о славных героических днях изгнания Джонса, о создании Семи Заповедей или о великой Битве, где были побиты двуногие захватчики. Они еще не оставили ни одну из своих старых грез. Они все еще верили, что настанет день, когда нога Человека не будет ступать по зеленым полям Англии, они верили в Республику Животных, предсказанную старым Майором. Когда-нибудь все это будет, возможно, не скоро, возможно, не при жизни нынешнего поколения, но будет. Даже "Всех Животных Британии", иногда, то там, то здесь, тайком напевали. Во всяком случае, каждый на ферме знал мотив этого гимна, хотя никто и не осмелился бы запеть его громко. Пусть их жизнь была тяжела, пусть не все их чаяния исполнялись, но все-таки они сознавали себя не такими, как все. Если они голодают, то не потому, что содержат двуногих тиранов. Если труд их и тяжел, работают они в конце концов на себя. Никто из них не ходит на задних лапах. Ни одно животное не называет другое животное "хозяин". Все звери равны.

Как-то раз в начале лета Визгун велел овцам следовать за ним и отвел их на пустырь, поросший молодыми березами на дальнем конце фермы. Овцы провели там целый день, объедая листву под надзором Визгуна. Вечером сам он возвратился в усадьбу, но овцам велел переночевать на пустыре, благо погода была теплая. Кончилось все тем, что овцы пробыли там всю неделю, и ни одно животное не виделось с ними все это время. Визгун проводил с овцами большую часть дня, сказав, что разучивает с ними новую песню, которая требует уединения.

Как раз в день возвращения овец, прекрасным летним вечером, когда животные закончили работу и держали путь в усадьбу, со двора раздалось испуганное ржание лошади. Пораженные животные остановились - это был голос Кашки. Она ржала не переставая и все бегом устремились вперед. Тут они увидели, что ее так испугало.

Свинью, которая передвигалась на задних ножках!

Конечно, это был Визгун. Несколько неуклюже - видимо, сказывался избыточный вес, - но все-таки удерживал равновесие, он разгуливал по двору. Минутой позже из дверей жилого дома вышла длинная вереница свиней, все на задних ножках. Иные проделывали это прытче остальных, а одна или две, наоборот, ступали нетвердо и им, похоже, совсем не помешали бы тросточки для опоры - но все успешно одолели весь путь вокруг двора. И, наконец, под устрашающий лай псов и пронзительное кукареканье петуха, с величественной прямой осанкой, бросая надменные взоры по сторонам, вышел Наполеон собственной персоной с собаками, скачущими вокруг него.

Он нес с собой бич.

Воцарилась мертвая тишина. Пораженные, напуганные, сгрудившись в кучу, смотрели животные на длинную вереницу свиней, которые неспешно вышагивали по периметру двора. Казалось, весь мир перевернулся вверх дном. Потом наступил момент, когда первое потрясение улеглось и когда они, вероятно, все-таки возроптали бы - несмотря на страх перед псами и вопреки выработанной годами привычке никогда ни в чем не перечить начальству... Но как раз в этот самый момент, как по сигналу, хор овец оглушительно заблеял:

ЧЕТЫРЕ НОГИ - ХОРОШО, ДВЕ НОГИ - ЛУЧШЕ! ЧЕТЫРЕ - ХОРОШО, ДВЕ - ЛУЧШЕ!

ЧЕТЫРЕ - ХОРОШО, ДВЕ - ЛУЧШЕ!

И продолжалось это минут пять без перерыва. А когда овцы смолкли, возможность как-то выразить свое недовольство была упущена, потому что свиньи уже промаршировали в дом.

Бенджамин почувствовал, что кто-то носом прижался к его плечу. Он оглянулся. Это была Кашка. Ее серые глаза потускнели еще больше. Не говоря ни слова, она осторожно потянула его за гриву и повела задворками к торцовой стене большого гумна, где были начертаны СЕМЬ ЗАПОВЕДЕЙ. Минуты две они стояли, вглядываясь в буквы, белеющие на фоне черной, просмоленной стены.

- Я теперь вижу плохо, - сказала, наконец, Кашка. - Правда, я и в молодости никогда не могла разобрать, что там написано. Но мне сдается, что стена выглядит как-то не так, как раньше. Бенджамин, Семь Заповедей не изменились?

Впервые Бенджамин отступил от своих правил. Он прочел вслух все, что было написано на стене. Теперь там была одна-единственная заповедь:

ВСЕ ЗВЕРИ РАВНЫ,

НО НЕКОТОРЫЕ РАВНЕЕ ДРУГИХ.

После этого никому уже не показалось странным, когда на следующий день свиньи, надзиравшие за полевыми работами, все принесли с собой бичи. Никого не удивило, что свиньи купили себе радио, собрались установить телефон, подписались на "Джона Буля", "Тит Битс", и "Дейли Миррор". Не показалось странным, когда увидели Наполеона на прогулке в саду с трубкой в зубах и даже когда свиньи выволокли весь гардероб мистера Джонса из платяного шкафа и напялили на себя. Сам Наполеон стал носить черное пальто, охотничьи штаны и кожаные краги, а его любимая хрюшка - шелковое муаровое платье, которое миссис Джонс, бывало, одевала по воскресеньям.

Неделю спустя, в послеполуденное время, к ферме подкатило несколько экипажей - депутация соседних фермеров, приехавших с ознакомительными целями по приглашению Наполеона. Они оглядели всю ферму и выразили величайшее восхищение увиденным, особенно мельницей. Животные пололи репу. Они работали прилежно, едва отрывая морды от земли и не зная, кого бояться больше свиней или двуногих посетителей.

Весь этот вечер из дома доносились громкий смех и взрывы пения. И звучание этих смешных голосов пробудило в обитателях фермы внезапное любопытство. Что случилось? Что это вдруг впервые заставило людей и животных встретиться на равных? Не сговариваясь, они единодушно решили пробраться в сад. У калитки вышла заминка, многие побаивались идти дальше, но Кашка показала пример. Они подкрались к дому и те, кому позволял рост, заглянули в окно гостиной. Там, за длинным столом, сидело человек шесть фермеров и полдюжины наиболее высокопоставленных свиней. Сам Наполеон занимал почетное место во главе стола. Свиньи восседали на стульях вполне непринужденно. Компания сидела за картами, но устроила перерыв, чтобы выслушать тост. По кругу передавали большой кувшин, бокалы наполнялись пивом. Никто не замечал заглядывающих в окно животных.

Мистер Пилькингтон из Фоксвуда поднял свой бокал.

- Через минуту, - сказал он, - я призову всех присутствующих осушить эти бокалы. Но я чувствую, что сперва обязан сказать несколько слов.

- Для меня, - сказал он, - было источником глубокого удовлетворения - и я уверен, что и для всех присутствующих тоже - почувствовать, что длительный период недоверия и взаимного непонимания теперь подошел к концу. Было время, когда (хотя не то чтобы я или кто из присутствующих разделял такие чувства), но было время, когда к уважаемым руководителям Зверской Фермы их соседи-люди относились - я бы не сказал "с враждебностью" - но, возможно, с определенной долей недоверия. Имели место прискорбные недоразумения, получали распространение ошибочные суждения. Почему-то полагали, что само существование фермы, которой владеют и управляют свиньи, - ненормально. Что оно будет оказывать разлагающее влияние на окружающий мир. Слишком многие фермеры без должного исследования пришли к выводу, что на такой ферме возобладает дух своеволия и анархии. Они беспокоились на счет возможного отрицательного влияния на своих собственных животных и даже на сельскохозяйственных рабочих. Однако ныне все эти сомнения полностью рассеяны. Сегодня я и мои коллеги посетили Зверскую Ферму и собственными глазами подробнейшим образом осмотрели ее. И что же мы обнаружили? Не только самую современную технологию, но и дисциплину, и порядок, каковые могут послужить образцом для всех. Я уверен, что не ошибусь, сказав, что рабочий скот Зверской Фермы трудится больше, а кормов переводит меньше, чем какая бы то ни было домашняя скотина в стране. Более того, я и мои спутники обратили внимание сегодня на многое такое, что мы намерены незамедлительно внедрить и в своих собственных владениях.

- Я закончу свои замечания, - сказал он, - тем, что подчеркну еще раз те дружеские чувства, которые питают друг к другу и должны питать руководители Зверской Фермы и их соседи. Между свиньями и представителями рода человеческого нет и не может быть никаких противоречий. Они ведут одну и ту же борьбу и сталкиваются с одинаковыми трудностями. Разве проблема рабочий силы не стоит перед вами так же, как и перед нами?

Тут стало ясно, что мистер Пилькингтон намерен поделиться с компанией какой-то заранее заготовленной остротой, но в течение целой минуты не был в состоянии выговорить ее, борясь с охватившем его смехом. Поперхнувшись несколько раз так, что его многочисленные подбородки побагровели, он, наконец, выдавил из себя: "Если у вас есть ваш рабочий скот, то и у нас есть так называемый рабочий класс!"

Эта шутка вызвала за столом взрыв хохота, а мистер Пилькингтон еще раз поздравил свиней с низким уровнем кормовых затрат, продолжительностью рабочего дня и общим состоянием дисциплины на Зверской Ферме.

- А теперь, - сказал он, - я бы попросил всех встать и проверить, полны ли ваши бокалы. Джентльмены! - сказал он в заключение, - джентльмены, я предлагаю тост за процветание Зверской Фермы!

В ответ раздались одобрительные возгласы, звон бокалов и топанье ног. Наполеон так растрогался, что оставил свое место и обошел стол кругом, дабы чокнуться с мистером Пилькингтоном, и лишь затем опрокинул свой бокал. Когда аплодисменты стихли, Наполеон, который продолжал стоять, объявил, что и он желает сказать несколько слов.

Как и все выступления Наполеона, эта речь была краткой и касалась самой сути дела.

- Я тоже счастлив, - сказал он, - что период взаимного непонимания подошел к концу. В течение долгого времени бытовали суждения, распространяемые, - у нас есть основания так думать - одним коварным врагом, будто есть нечто подрывное и даже революционное в воззрениях многих моих коллег. О нас думали, будто мы стремимся к разжиганию мятежей домашнего скота на соседних фермах. В этом нет ни капли правды. Мое заветное желание теперь, как и прежде - это жить в мире и поддерживать нормальные деловые отношения со своими соседями. Кстати, эта ферма, которой я имею честь управлять, - добавил он, - предприятие кооперативное. Имеющиеся у нас документы на владение являются общей собственностью всех свиней.

- Я не думаю, - продолжил Наполеон, - что старые подозрения еще тревожат наших соседей. Тем не менее, совсем недавно в заведенных на ферме порядках были осуществлены кое-какие перемены, которые еще больше укрепят к ней доверие. До сих пор животные фермы придерживались дурацкого обычая обращаться друг к другу со словом "товарищ". Отныне это будет запрещено. Был еще один очень странный обычай, происхождение которого неизвестно, - каждое воскресенье маршировать перед черепом старого хряка, прибитом в саду на столбе. Это тоже будет запрещено, а череп уже предан земле. Наши гости, должно быть, видели зеленое знамя, которое развевается на флагштоке. Если так, то вы, наверное, обратили внимание, что белые копыта и рог, ранее на нем вышитые, теперь закрашены. Отныне и впредь у нас будет просто зеленое знамя.

- У меня есть только одна поправка, - сказал он также, - к замечательному и добрососедскому выступлению мистера Пилькингтона. Мистер Пилькингтон все время говорил "Зверская Ферма". Разумеется, он не мог знать - ибо я только теперь впервые об этом объявляю, - что название "Зверская Ферма" отменяется. Отныне и навеки ферму следует именовать "Барской Фермой", ибо я полагаю, что таково ее истинное и исконное название.

- Джентльмены! - закончил свое выступление Наполеон - Я предлагаю тот же самый тост - только чуть-чуть по-другому. Вот мой тост, джентльмены: За процветание Барской Фермы!

Снова раздались одобрительные восклицания, и бокалы были осушены до дна. Но животным, которые наблюдали сцену снаружи, казалось, будто происходит что-то странное. Что сделалось со свиными рылами? Взгляд старых тусклых глаз Кашки переходил с одной морды на другую. Все как-то стало нечетким и зыбким. На той морде было пять подбородков, на другой - четыре, на этой - три. Когда аплодисменты стихли, компания снова взялась за карты и вернулась к прерванной игре, а животные молча побрели прочь.

Они, однако, не прошли и двадцати ярдов, как вдруг остановились. Из дома доносились дикие вопли. Животные бросились назад к окну. В доме разгорался страшный скандал: крики, удары по столу, пронзительные подозрительные взгляды, неистовые отрицания. Мистер Пилькингтон и Наполеон оба одновременно сыграли тузом пик - это и оказалось источником конфликта.

Двенадцать глоток вопили враз, и все - совершенно одинаково. Стало понятно, что сделалось со свиными рылами. Животные снаружи переводили взгляд от свиньи к человеку, от человека опять к свинье, но кто был кем, различить было уже невозможно.

Rudyard Kipling
My Own True Ghost Story
As I came through the Desert thus it was— As I came through the Desert. The City of Dreadful Night.

Somewhere in the Other World, where there are books and pictures and plays and shop windows to look at, and thousands of men who spend their lives in building up all four, lives a gentleman who writes real stories about the real insides of people; and his name is Mr. Walter Besant. But he will insist upon treating his ghosts—he has published half a workshopful of them—with levity. He makes his ghost-seers talk familiarly, and, in some cases, flirt outrageously, with the phantoms. You may treat anything, from a Viceroy to a Vernacular Paper, with levity; but you must behave reverently toward a ghost, and particularly an Indian one.

There are, in this land, ghosts who take the form of fat, cold, pobby corpses, and hide in trees near the roadside till a traveler passes. Then they drop upon his neck and remain. There are also terrible ghosts of women who have died in child-bed. These wander along the pathways at dusk, or hide in the crops near a village, and call seductively. But to answer their call is death in this world and the next. Their feet are turned backward that all sober men may recognize them. There are ghosts of little children who have been thrown into wells. These haunt well curbs and the fringes of jungles, and wail under the stars, or catch women by the wrist and beg to be taken up and carried. These and the corpse ghosts, however, are only vernacular articles and do not attack Sahibs. No native ghost has yet been authentically reported to have frightened an Englishman; but many English ghosts have scared the life out of both white and black.

Nearly every other Station owns a ghost. There are said to be two at Simla, not counting the woman who blows the bellows at Syree dâk-bungalow on the Old Road; Mussoorie has a house haunted of a very lively Thing; a White Lady is supposed to do night-watchman round a house in Lahore; Dalhousie says that one of her houses "repeats" on autumn evenings all the incidents of a horrible horse-and-precipice accident; Murree has a merry ghost, and, now that she has been swept by cholera, will have room for a sorrowful one; there are Officers' Quarters in Mian Mir whose doors open without reason, and whose furniture is guaranteed to creak, not with the heat of June but with the weight of Invisibles who come to lounge in the chairs; Peshawur possesses houses that none will willingly rent; and there is something—not fever—wrong with a big bungalow in Allahabad. The older Provinces simply bristle with haunted houses, and march phantom armies along their main thoroughfares.

Some of the dâk-bungalows on the Grand Trunk Road have handy little cemeteries in their compound—witnesses to the "changes and chances of this mortal life" in the days when men drove from Calcutta to the Northwest. These bungalows are objectionable places to put up in. They are generally very old, always dirty, while the khansamah is as ancient as the bungalow. He either chatters senilely, or falls into the long trances of age. In both moods he is useless. If you get angry with him, he refers to some Sahib dead and buried these thirty years, and says that when he was in that Sahib's service not a khansamah in the Province could touch him. Then he jabbers and mows and trembles and fidgets among the dishes, and you repent of your irritation.

In these dâk-bungalows, ghosts are most likely to be found, and when found, they should be made a note of. Not long ago it was my business to live in dâk-bungalows. I never inhabited the same house for three nights running, and grew to be learned in the breed. I lived in Government-built ones with red brick walls and rail ceilings, an inventory of the furniture posted in every room, and an excited snake at the threshold to give welcome. I lived in "converted" ones—old houses officiating as dâk-bungalows—where nothing was in its proper place and there wasn't even a fowl for dinner. I lived in second-hand palaces where the wind blew through open-work marble tracery just as uncomfortably as through a broken pane. I lived in dâk-bungalows where the last entry in the visitors' book was fifteen months old, and where they slashed off the curry-kid's head with a sword. It was my good luck to meet all sorts of men, from sober traveling missionaries and deserters flying from British Regiments, to drunken loafers who threw whisky bottles at all who passed; and my still greater good fortune just to escape a maternity case. Seeing that a fair proportion of the tragedy of our lives out here acted itself in dâk-bungalows, I wondered that I had met no ghosts. A ghost that would voluntarily hang about a dâk-bungalow would be mad of course; but so many men have died mad in dâk-bungalows that there must be a fair percentage of lunatic ghosts.

In due time I found my ghost, or ghosts rather, for there were two of them. Up till that hour I had sympathized with Mr. Besant's method of handling them, as shown in "The Strange Case of Mr. Lucraft and Other Stories." I am now in the Opposition.

We will call the bungalow Katmal dâk-bungalow. But that was the smallest part of the horror. A man with a sensitive hide has no right to sleep in dâk-bungalows. He should marry. Katmal dâk-bungalow was old and rotten and unrepaired. The floor was of worn brick, the walls were filthy, and the windows were nearly black with grime. It stood on a bypath largely used by native Sub-Deputy Assistants of all kinds, from Finance to Forests; but real Sahibs were rare. The khansamah, who was nearly bent double with old age, said so.

When I arrived, there was a fitful, undecided rain on the face of the land, accompanied by a restless wind, and every gust made a noise like the rattling of dry bones in the stiff toddy palms outside. The khansamah completely lost his head on my arrival. He had served a Sahib once. Did I know that Sahib? He gave me the name of a well-known man who has been buried for more than a quarter of a century, and showed me an ancient daguerreotype of that man in his prehistoric youth. I had seen a steel engraving of him at the head of a double volume of Memoirs a month before, and I felt ancient beyond telling.

The day shut in and the khansamah went to get me food. He did not go through the, pretense of calling it "khana"—man's victuals. He said "ratub," and that means, among other things, "grub"—dog's rations. There was no insult in his choice of the term. He had forgotten the other word, I suppose.

While he was cutting up the dead bodies of animals, I settled myself down, after exploring the dâk-bungalow. There were three rooms, beside my own, which was a corner kennel, each giving into the other through dingy white doors fastened with long iron bars. The bungalow was a very solid one, but the partition walls of the rooms were almost jerry-built in their flimsiness. Every step or bang of a trunk echoed from my room down the other three, and every footfall came back tremulously from the far walls. For this reason I shut the door. There were no lamps—only candles in long glass shades. An oil wick was set in the bathroom.

For bleak, unadulterated misery that dâk-bungalow was the worst of the many that I had ever set foot in. There was no fireplace, and the windows would not open; so a brazier of charcoal would have been useless. The rain and the wind splashed and gurgled and moaned round the house, and the toddy palms rattled and roared. Half a dozen jackals went through the compound singing, and a hyena stood afar off and mocked them. A hyena would convince a Sadducee of the Resurrection of the Dead—the worst sort of Dead. Then came the ratub—a curious meal, half native and half English in composition—with the old khansamah babbling behind my chair about dead and gone English people, and the wind-blown candles playing shadow-bo-peep with the bed and the mosquito-curtains. It was just the sort of dinner and evening to make a man think of every single one of his past sins, and of all the others that he intended to commit if he lived.

Sleep, for several hundred reasons, was not easy. The lamp in the bathroom threw the most absurd shadows into the room, and the wind was beginning to talk nonsense.

Just when the reasons were drowsy with blood-sucking I heard the regular—"Let-us-take-and-heave-him-over" grunt of doolie-bearers in the compound. First one doolie came in, then a second, and then a third. I heard the doolies dumped on the ground, and the shutter in front of my door shook. "That's some one trying to come in," I said. But no one spoke, and I persuaded myself that it was the gusty wind. The shutter of the room next to mine was attacked, flung back, and the inner door opened. "That's some Sub-Deputy Assistant," I said, "and he has brought his friends with him. Now they'll talk and spit and smoke for an hour."

But there were no voices and no footsteps. No one was putting his luggage into the next room. The door shut, and I thanked Providence that I was to be left in peace. But I was curious to know where the doolies had gone. I got out of bed and looked into the darkness. There was never a sign of a doolie. Just as I was getting into bed again, I heard, in the next room, the sound that no man in his senses can possibly mistake—the whir of a billiard ball down the length of the slates when the striker is stringing for break. No other sound is like it. A minute afterwards there was another whir, and I got into bed. I was not frightened—indeed I was not. I was very curious to know what had become of the doolies. I jumped into bed for that reason.

Next minute I heard the double click of a cannon and my hair sat up. It is a mistake to say that hair stands up. The skin of the head tightens and you can feel a faint, prickly, bristling all over the scalp. That is the hair sitting up.

There was a whir and a click, and both sounds could only have been made by one thing—a billiard ball. I argued the matter out at great length with myself; and the more I argued the less probable it seemed that one bed, one table, and two chairs—all the furniture of the room next to mine—could so exactly duplicate the sounds of a game of billiards. After another cannon, a three-cushion one to judge by the whir, I argued no more. I had found my ghost and would have given worlds to have escaped from that dâk-bungalow. I listened, and with each listen the game grew clearer. There was whir on whir and click on click. Sometimes there was a double click and a whir and another click. Beyond any sort of doubt, people were playing billiards in the next room. And the next room was not big enough to hold a billiard table!

Between the pauses of the wind I heard the game go forward—stroke after stroke. I tried to believe that I could not hear voices; but that attempt was a failure.

Do you know what fear is? Not ordinary fear of insult, injury or death, but abject, quivering dread of something that you cannot see—fear that dries the inside of the mouth and half of the throat—fear that makes you sweat on the palms of the hands, and gulp in order to keep the uvula at work? This is a fine Fear—a great cowardice, and must be felt to be appreciated. The very improbability of billiards in a dâk-bungalow proved the reality of the thing. No man—drunk or sober—could imagine a game at billiards, or invent the spitting crack of a "screw-cannon."

A severe course of dâk-bungalows has this disadvantage—it breeds infinite credulity. If a man said to a confirmed dâk-bungalow-haunter:—"There is a corpse in the next room, and there's a mad girl in the next but one, and the woman and man on that camel have just eloped from a place sixty miles away," the hearer would not disbelieve because he would know that nothing is too wild, grotesque, or horrible to happen in a dâk-bungalow.

This credulity, unfortunately, extends to ghosts. A rational person fresh from his own house would have turned on his side and slept. I did not. So surely as I was given up as a bad carcass by the scores of things in the bed because the bulk of my blood was in my heart, so surely did I hear every stroke of a long game at billiards played in the echoing room behind the iron-barred door. My dominant fear was that the players might want a marker. It was an absurd fear; because creatures who could play in the dark would be above such superfluities. I only know that that was my terror; and it was real.

After a long, long while the game stopped, and the door banged. I slept because I was dead tired. Otherwise I should have preferred to have kept awake. Not for everything in Asia would I have dropped the door-bar and peered into the dark of the next room.

When the morning came, I considered that I had done well and wisely, and inquired for the means of departure.

"By the way, khansamah," I said, "what were those three doolies doing in my compound in the night?"

"There were no doolies," said the khansamah.

I went into the next room and the daylight streamed through the open door. I was immensely brave. I would, at that hour, have played Black Pool with the owner of the big Black Pool down below.

"Has this place always been a dâk-bungalow?" I asked.

"No," said the khansamah. "Ten or twenty years ago, I have forgotten how long, it was a billiard room."

"A how much?"

"A billiard room for the Sahibs who built the Railway. I was khansamah then in the big house where all the Railway-Sahibs lived, and I used to come across with brandy-shrab. These three rooms were all one, and they held a big table on which the Sahibs played every evening. But the Sahibs are all dead now, and the Railway runs, you say, nearly to Kabul."

"Do you remember anything about the Sahibs?"

"It is long ago, but I remember that one Sahib, a fat man and always angry, was playing here one night, and he said to me:—'Mangal Khan, brandy-pani do,' and I filled the glass, and he bent over the table to strike, and his head fell lower and lower till it hit the table, and his spectacles came off, and when we—the Sahibs and I myself—ran to lift him he was dead. I helped to carry him out. Aha, he was a strong Sahib! But he is dead and I, old Mangal Khan, am still living, by your favor."

That was more than enough! I had my ghost—a first-hand, authenticated article. I would write to the Society for Psychical Research—I would paralyze the Empire with the news! But I would, first of all, put eighty miles of assessed crop land between myself and that dâk-bungalow before nightfall. The Society might send their regular agent to investigate later on.

I went into my own room and prepared to pack after noting down the facts of the case. As I smoked I heard the game begin again,—with a miss in balk this time, for the whir was a short one.

The door was open and I could see into the room. Click—click! That was a cannon. I entered the room without fear, for there was sunlight within and a fresh breeze without. The unseen game was going on at a tremendous rate. And well it might, when a restless little rat was running to and fro inside the dingy ceiling-cloth, and a piece of loose window-sash was making fifty breaks off the window-bolt as it shook in the breeze!

Impossible to mistake the sound of billiard balls! Impossible to mistake the whir of a ball over the slate! But I was to be excused. Even when I shut my enlightened eyes the sound was marvelously like that of a fast game.

Entered angrily the faithful partner of my sorrows, Kadir Baksh.

"This bungalow is very bad and low-caste! No wonder the Presence was disturbed and is speckled. Three sets of doolie-bearers came to the bungalow late last night when I was sleeping outside, and said that it was their custom to rest in the rooms set apart for the English people! What honor has the khansamah? They tried to enter, but I told them to go. No wonder, if these Oorias have been here, that the Presence is sorely spotted. It is shame, and the work of a dirty man!"

Kadir Baksh did not say that he had taken from each gang two annas for rent in advance, and then, beyond my earshot, had beaten them with the big green umbrella whose use I could never before divine. But Kadir Baksh has no notions of morality.

There was an interview with the khansamah, but as he promptly lost his head, wrath gave place to pity, and pity led to a long conversation, in the course of which he put the fat Engineer-Sahib's tragic death in three separate stations—two of them fifty miles away. The third shift was to Calcutta, and there the Sahib died while driving a dog-cart.

If I had encouraged him the khansamah would have wandered all through Bengal with his corpse.

I did not go away as soon as I intended. I stayed for the night, while the wind and the rat and the sash and the window-bolt played a ding-dong "hundred and fifty up." Then the wind ran out and the billiards stopped, and I felt that I had ruined my one genuine, hall-marked ghost story.

Had I only stopped at the proper time, I could have made anything out of it.

That was the bitterest thought of all!
The Sending of Dana Da
When the Devil rides on your chest, remember the chamar. —Native Proverb.

Once upon a time some people in India made a new heaven and a new earth out of broken teacups, a missing brooch or two, and a hair brush. These were hidden under bushes, or stuffed into holes in the hillside, and an entire civil service of subordinate gods used to find or mend them again; and everyone said: "There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy." Several other things happened also, but the religion never seemed to get much beyond its first manifestations; though it added an air-line postal dak, and orchestral effects in order to keep abreast of the times, and stall off competition.

This religion was too elastic for ordinary use. It stretched itself and embraced pieces of everything that medicine men of all ages have manufactured. It approved and stole from Freemasonry; looted the Latter-day Rosicrucians of half their pet words; took any fragments of Egyptian philosophy that it found in the Encyclopædia Britannica; annexed as many of the Vedas as had been translated into French or English, and talked of all the rest; built in the German versions of what is left of the Zend Avesta; encouraged white, gray, and black magic, including Spiritualism, palmistry, fortune-telling by cards, hot chestnuts, double-kerneled nuts and tallow droppings; would have adopted Voodoo and Oboe had it known anything about them, and showed itself, in every way, one of the most accommodating arrangements that had ever been invented since the birth of the sea.

When it was in thorough working order, with all the machinery down to the subscriptions complete, Dana Da came from nowhere, with nothing in his hands, and wrote a chapter in its history which has hitherto been unpublished. He said that his first name was Dana, and his second was Da. Now, setting aside Dana of the New York Sun, Dana is a Bhil name, and Da fits no native of India unless you accept the Bengali Dé as the original spelling. Da is Lap or Finnish; and Dana Da was neither Finn, Chin, Bhil, Bengali, Lap, Nair, Gond, Romaney, Magh, Bokhariot, Kurd, Armenian, Levantine, Jew, Persian, Punjabi, Madrasi, Parsee, nor anything else known to ethnologists. He was simply Dana Da, and declined to give further information. For the sake of brevity, and as roughly indicating his origin, he was called "The Native." He might have been the original Old Man of the Mountains, who is said to be the only authorized head of the Teacup Creed. Some people said that he was; but Dana Da used to smile and deny any connection with the cult; explaining that he was an "independent experimenter."

As I have said, he came from nowhere, with his hands behind his back, and studied the creed for three weeks; sitting at the feet of those best competent to explain its mysteries. Then he laughed aloud and went away, but the laugh might have been either of devotion or derision.

When he returned he was without money, but his pride was unabated. He declared that he knew more about the things in heaven and earth than those who taught him, and for this contumacy was abandoned altogether.

His next appearance in public life was at a big cantonment in Upper India, and he was then telling fortunes with the help of three leaden dice, a very dirty old cloth, and a little tin box of opium pills. He told better fortunes when he was allowed half a bottle of whisky; but the things which he invented on the opium were quite worth the money. He was in reduced circumstances. Among other people's he told the fortune of an Englishman who had once been interested in the Simla creed, but who, later on, had married and forgotten all his old knowledge in the study of babies and Exchange. The Englishman allowed Dana Da to tell a fortune for charity's sake, and, gave him five rupees, a dinner, and some old clothes. When he had eaten, Dana Da professed gratitude, and asked if there were anything he could do for his host—in the esoteric line.

"Is there anyone that you love?" said Dana Da. The Englishman loved his wife, but had no desire to drag her name into the conversation. He therefore shook his head.

"Is there anyone that you hate?" said Dana Da. The Englishman said that there were several men whom he hated deeply.

"Very good," said Dana Da, upon whom the whisky and the opium were beginning to tell. "Only give me their names, and I will dispatch a Sending to them and kill them."

Now a Sending is a horrible arrangement, first invented, they say, in Iceland. It is a thing sent by a wizard, and may take any form, but most generally wanders about the land in the shape of a little purple cloud till it finds the sendee, and him it kills by changing into the form of a horse, or a cat, or a man without a face. It is not strictly a native patent, though chamars can, if irritated, dispatch a Sending which sits on the breast of their enemy by night and nearly kills him. Very few natives care to irritate chamars for this reason.

"Let me dispatch a Sending," said Dana Da; "I am nearly dead now with want, and drink, and opium; but I should like to kill a man before I die. I can send a Sending anywhere you choose, and in any form except in the shape of a man."

The Englishman had no friends that he wished to kill, but partly to soothe Dana Da, whose eyes were rolling, and partly to see what would be done, he asked whether a modified Sending could not be arranged for—such a Sending as should make a man's life a burden to him, and yet do him no harm. If this were possible, he notified his willingness to give Dana Da ten rupees for the job.

"I am not what I was once," said Dana Da, "and I must take the money because I am poor. To what Englishman shall I send it?"

"Send a Sending to Lone Sahib," said the Englishman, naming a man who had been most bitter in rebuking him for his apostasy from the Teacup Creed. Dana Da laughed and nodded.

"I could have chosen no better man myself," said he. "I will see that he finds the Sending about his path and about his bed."

He lay down on the hearthrug, turned up the whites of his eyes, shivered all over, and began to snort. This was magic, or opium, or the Sending, or all three. When he opened his eyes he vowed that the Sending had started upon the warpath, and was at that moment flying up to the town where Lone Sahib lives.

"Give me my ten rupees," said Dana Da, wearily, "and write a letter to Lone Sahib, telling him, and all who believe with him, that you and a friend are using a power greater than theirs. They will see that you are speaking the truth."

He departed unsteadily, with the promise of some more rupees if anything came of the Sending.

The Englishman sent a letter to Lone Sahib, couched in what he remembered of the terminology of the creed. He wrote: "I also, in the days of what you held to be my backsliding, have obtained enlightenment, and with enlightenment has come power." Then he grew so deeply mysterious that the recipient of the letter could make neither head nor tail of it, and was proportionately impressed; for he fancied that his friend had become a "fifth rounder." When a man is a "fifth rounder" he can do more than Slade and Houdin combined.

Lone Sahib read the letter in five different fashions, and was beginning a sixth interpretation, when his bearer dashed in with the news that there was a cat on the bed. Now, if there was one thing that Lone Sahib hated more than another it was a cat. He rated the bearer for not turning it out of the house. The bearer said that he was afraid. All the doors of the bedroom had been shut throughout the morning, and no real cat could possibly have entered the room. He would prefer not to meddle with the creature.

Lone Sahib entered the room gingerly, and there, on the pillow of his bed, sprawled and whimpered a wee white kitten, not a jumpsome, frisky little beast, but a sluglike crawler with its eyes barely opened and its paws lacking strength or direction—a kitten that ought to have been in a basket with its mamma. Lone Sahib caught it by the scruff of its neck, handed it over to the sweeper to be drowned, and fined the bearer four annas.

That evening, as he was reading in his room, he fancied that he saw something moving about on the hearthrug, outside the circle of light from his reading lamp. When the thing began to myowl, he realized that it was a kitten—a wee white kitten, nearly blind and very miserable. He was seriously angry, and spoke bitterly to his bearer, who said that there was no kitten in the room when he brought in the lamp, and real kittens of tender age generally had mother cats in attendance.

"If the Presence will go out into the veranda and listen," said the bearer, "he will hear no cats. How, therefore, can the kitten on the bed and the kitten on the hearthrug be real kittens?"

Lone Sahib went out to listen, and the bearer followed him, but there was no sound of Rachel mewing for her children. He returned to his room, having hurled the kitten down the hillside, and wrote out the incidents of the day for the benefit of his coreligionists. Those people were so absolutely free from superstition that they ascribed anything a little out of the common to agencies. As it was their business to know all about the agencies, they were on terms of almost indecent familiarity with manifestations of every kind. Their letters dropped from the ceiling—unstamped—and spirits used to squatter up and down their staircases all night. But they had never come into contact with kittens. Lone Sahib wrote out the facts, noting the hour and the minute, as every psychical observer is bound to do, and appending the Englishman's letter because it was the most mysterious document and might have had a bearing upon anything in this world or the next. An outsider would have translated all the tangle thus: "Look out! You laughed at me once, and now I am going to make you sit up."

Lone Sahib's coreligionists found that meaning in it; but their translation was refined and full of four-syllable words. They held a sederunt, and were filled with tremulous joy, for, in spite of their familiarity with all the other worlds and cycles, they had a very human awe of things sent from ghostland. They met in Lone Sahib's room in shrouded and sepulchral gloom, and their conclave was broken up by a clinking among the photo frames on the mantelpiece. A wee white kitten, nearly blind, was looping and writhing itself between the clock and the candlesticks. That stopped all investigations or doubtings. Here was the manifestation in the flesh. It was, so far as could be seen, devoid of purpose, but it was a manifestation of undoubted authenticity.

They drafted a round robin to the Englishman, the backslider of old days, adjuring him in the interests of the creed to explain whether there was any connection between the embodiment of some Egyptian god or other (I have forgotten the name) and his communication. They called the kitten Ra, or Toth, or Shem, or Noah, or something; and when Lone Sahib confessed that the first one had, at his most misguided instance, been drowned by the sweeper, they said consolingly that in his next life he would be a "bounder," and not even a "rounder" of the lowest grade. These words may not be quite correct, but they express the sense of the house accurately.

When the Englishman received the round robin—it came by post—he was startled and bewildered. He sent into the bazaar for Dana Da, who read the letter and laughed. "That is my Sending," said he. "I told you I would work well. Now give me another ten rupees."

"But what in the world is this gibberish about Egyptian gods?" asked the Englishman.

"Cats," said Dana Da, with a hiccough, for he had discovered the Englishman's whisky bottle. "Cats and cats and cats! Never was such a Sending. A hundred of cats. Now give me ten more rupees and write as I dictate."

Dana Da's letter was a curiosity. It bore the Englishman's signature, and hinted at cats—at a Sending of cats. The mere words on paper were creepy and uncanny to behold.

"What have you done, though?" said the Englishman; "I am as much in the dark as ever. Do you mean to say that you can actually send this absurd Sending you talk about?"

"Judge for yourself," said Dana Da. "What does that letter mean? In a little time they will all be at my feet and yours, and I, oh, glory! will be drugged or drunk all day long."

Dana Da knew his people.

When a man who hates cats wakes up in the morning and finds a little squirming kitten on his breast, or puts his hand into his ulster pocket and finds a little half-dead kitten where his gloves should be, or opens his trunk and finds a vile kitten among his dress shirts, or goes for a long ride with his mackintosh strapped on his saddle-bow and shakes a little sprawling kitten from its folds when he opens it, or goes out to dinner and finds a little blind kitten under his chair, or stays at home and finds a writhing kitten under the quilt, or wriggling among his boots, or hanging, head downward, in his tobacco jar, or being mangled by his terrier in the veranda—when such a man finds one kitten, neither more nor less, once a day in a place where no kitten rightly could or should be, he is naturally upset. When he dare not murder his daily trove because he believes it to be a manifestation, an emissary, an embodiment, and half a dozen other things all out of the regular course of nature, he is more than upset. He is actually distressed. Some of Lone Sahib's coreligionists thought that he was a highly favored individual; but many said that if he had treated the first kitten with proper respect—as suited a Toth-Ra Tum-Sennacherib Embodiment—all his trouble would have been averted. They compared him to the Ancient Mariner, but none the less they were proud of him and proud of the Englishman who had sent the manifestation. They did not call it a Sending because Icelandic magic was not in their programme.

After sixteen kittens—that is to say, after one fortnight, for there were three kittens on the first day to impress the fact of the Sending, the whole camp was uplifted by a letter—it came flying through a window—from the Old Man of the Mountains—the head of all the creed—explaining the manifestation in the most beautiful language and soaking up all the credit of it for himself. The Englishman, said the letter, was not there at all. He was a backslider without power or asceticism, who couldn't even raise a table by force of volition, much less project an army of kittens through space. The entire arrangement, said the letter, was strictly orthodox, worked and sanctioned by the highest authorities within the pale of the creed. There was great joy at this, for some of the weaker brethren seeing that an outsider who had been working on independent lines could create kittens, whereas their own rulers had never gone beyond crockery—and broken at that—were showing a desire to break line on their own trail. In fact, there was the promise of a schism. A second round robin was drafted to the Englishman, beginning: "Oh, Scoffer," and ending with a selection of curses from the rites of Mizraim and Memphis and the Commination of Jugana; who was a "fifth rounder," upon whose name an upstart "third rounder" once traded. A papal excommunication is a billet-doux compared to the Commination of Jugana. The Englishman had been proved under the hand and seal of the Old Man of the Mountains to have appropriated virtue and pretended to have power which, in reality, belonged only to the supreme head. Naturally the round robin did not spare him.

He handed the letter to Dana Da to translate into decent English. The effect on Dana Da was curious. At first he was furiously angry, and then he laughed for five minutes.

"I had thought," he said, "that they would have come to me. In another week I would have shown that I sent the Sending, and they would have discrowned the Old Man of the Mountains who has sent this Sending of mine. Do you do nothing. The time has come for me to act. Write as I dictate, and I will put them to shame. But give me ten more rupees."

At Dana Da's dictation the Englishman wrote nothing less than a formal challenge to the Old Man of the Mountains. It wound up: "And if this manifestation be from your hand, then let it go forward; but if it be from my hand, I will that the Sending shall cease in two days' time. On that day there shall be twelve kittens and thenceforward none at all. The people shall judge between us." This was signed by Dana Da, who added pentacles and pentagrams, and a crux ansata, and half a dozen swastikas, and a Triple Tau to his name, just to show that he was all he laid claim to be.

The challenge was read out to the gentlemen and ladies, and they remembered then that Dana Da had laughed at them some years ago. It was officially announced that the Old Man of the Mountains would treat the matter with contempt; Dana Da being an independent investigator without a single "round" at the back of him. But this did not soothe his people. They wanted to see a fight. They were very human for all their spirituality. Lone Sahib, who was really being worn out with kittens, submitted meekly to his fate. He felt that he was being "kittened to prove the power of Dana Da," as the poet says.

When the stated day dawned, the shower of kittens began. Some were white and some were tabby, and all were about the same loathsome age. Three were on his hearthrug, three in his bathroom, and the other six turned up at intervals among the visitors who came to see the prophecy break down. Never was a more satisfactory Sending. On the next day there were no kittens, and the next day and all the other days were kittenless and quiet. The people murmured and looked to the Old Man of the Mountains for an explanation. A letter, written on a palm leaf, dropped from the ceiling, but everyone except Lone Sahib felt that letters were not what the occasion demanded. There should have been cats, there should have been cats—full-grown ones. The letter proved conclusively that there had been a hitch in the psychic current which, colliding with a dual identity, had interfered with the percipient activity all along the main line. The kittens were still going on, but owing to some failure in the developing fluid, they were not materialized. The air was thick with letters for a few days afterwards. Unseen hands played Glück and Beethoven on finger-bowls and clock shades; but all men felt that psychic life was a mockery without materialized kittens. Even Lone Sahib shouted with the majority on this head. Dana Da's letters were very insulting, and if he had then offered to lead a new departure, there is no knowing what might not have happened.

But Dana Da was dying of whisky and opium in the Englishman's go-down, and had small heart for new creeds.

"They have been put to shame," said he. "Never was such a Sending. It has killed me."

"Nonsense," said the Englishman, "you are going to die, Dana Da, and that sort of stuff must be left behind. I'll admit that you have made some queer things come about. Tell me honestly, now, how was it done?"

"Give me ten more rupees," said Dana Da, faintly, "and if I die before I spend them, bury them with me." The silver was counted out while Dana Da was fighting with death. His hand closed upon the money and he smiled a grim smile.

"Bend low," he whispered. The Englishman bent.

"Bunnia—mission school—expelled—box-wallah (peddler)—Ceylon pearl merchant—all mine English education—outcasted, and made up name Dana Da—England with American thought-reading man and—and—you gave me ten rupees several times—I gave the Sahib's bearer two-eight a month for cats—little, little cats. I wrote, and he put them about—very clever man. Very few kittens now in the bazaar. Ask Lone Sahib's sweeper's wife."

So saying, Dana Da gasped and passed away into a land where, if all be true, there are no materializations and the making of new creeds is discouraged.

But consider the gorgeous simplicity of it all!
In the House of Suddhoo
A stone's throw out on either hand From that well-ordered road we tread, And all the world is wild and strange; Churel and ghoul and Djinn and sprite Shall bear us company to-night, For we have reached the Oldest Land Wherein the Powers of Darkness range.
—From the Dusk to the Dawn.

The house of Suddhoo, near the Taksali Gate, is two storied, with four carved windows of old brown wood, and a flat roof. You may recognize it by five red handprints arranged like the Five of Diamonds on the whitewash between the upper windows. Bhagwan Dass, the bunnia, and a man who says he gets his living by seal-cutting live in the lower story with a troop of wives, servants, friends, and retainers. The two upper rooms used to be occupied by Janoo and Azizun and a little black-and-tan terrier that was stolen from an Englishman's house and given to Janoo by a soldier. To-day, only Janoo lives in the upper rooms. Suddhoo sleeps on the roof generally, except when he sleeps in the street. He used to go to Peshawar in the cold weather to visit his son, who sells curiosities near the Edwardes' Gate, and then he slept under a real mud roof. Suddhoo is a great friend of mine, because his cousin had a son who secured, thanks to my recommendation, the post of head messenger to a big firm in the Station. Suddhoo says that God will make me a Lieutenant-Governor one of these days. I daresay his prophecy will come true. He is very, very old, with white hair and no teeth worth showing, and he has outlived his wits—outlived nearly everything except his fondness for his son at Peshawar. Janoo and Azizun are Kashmiris, Ladies of the City, and theirs was an ancient and more or less honorable profession; but Azizun has since married a medical student from the Northwest and has settled down to a most respectable life somewhere near Bareilly. Bhagwan Dass is an extortionate and an adulterator. He is very rich. The man who is supposed to get his living by seal cutting pretends to be very poor. This lets you know as much as is necessary of the four principal tenants in the house of Suddhoo. Then there is Me, of course; but I am only the chorus that comes in at the end to explain things. So I do not count.

Suddhoo was not clever. The man who pretended to cut seals was the cleverest of them all—Bhagwan Dass only knew how to lie—except Janoo. She was also beautiful, but that was her own affair.

Suddhoo's son at Peshawar was attacked by pleurisy, and old Suddhoo was troubled. The seal-cutter man heard of Suddhoo's anxiety and made capital out of it. He was abreast of the times. He got a friend in Peshawar to telegraph daily accounts of the son's health. And here the story begins.

Suddhoo's cousin's son told me, one evening, that Suddhoo wanted to see me; that he was too old and feeble to come personally, and that I should be conferring an everlasting honor on the House of Suddhoo if I went to him. I went; but I think, seeing how well off Suddhoo was then, that he might have sent something better than an ekka, which jolted fearfully, to haul out a future Lieutenant-Governor to the City on a muggy April evening. The ekka did not run quickly. It was full dark when we pulled up opposite the door of Ranjit Singh's Tomb near the main gate of the Fort. Here was Suddhoo and he said that by reason of my condescension, it was absolutely certain that I should become a Lieutenant-Governor while my hair was yet black. Then we talked about the weather and the state of my health, and the wheat crops, for fifteen minutes, in the Huzuri Bagh, under the stars.

Suddhoo came to the point at last. He said that Janoo had told him that there was an order of the Sirkar against magic, because it was feared that magic might one day kill the Empress of India. I didn't know anything about the state of the law; but I fancied that something interesting was going to happen. I said that so far from magic being discouraged by the Government it was highly commended. The greatest officials of the State practiced it themselves. (If the Financial Statement isn't magic, I don't know what is.) Then, to encourage him further, I said that, if there was any jadoo afoot, I had not the least objection to giving it my countenance and sanction, and to seeing that it was clean jadoo—white magic, as distinguished from the unclean jadoo which kills folk. It took a long time before Suddhoo admitted that this was just what he had asked me to come for. Then he told me, in jerks and quavers, that the man who said he cut seals was a sorcerer of the cleanest kind; that every day he gave Suddhoo news of his sick son in Peshawar more quickly than the lightning could fly, and that this news was always corroborated by the letters. Further, that he had told Suddhoo how a great danger was threatening his son, which could be removed by clean jadoo; and, of course, heavy payment. I began to see exactly how the land lay, and told Suddhoo that I also understood a little jadoo in the Western line, and would go to his house to see that everything was done decently and in order. We set off together; and on the way Suddhoo told me that he had paid the seal cutter between one hundred and two hundred rupees already; and the jadoo of that night would cost two hundred more. Which was cheap, he said, considering the greatness of his son's danger; but I do not think he meant it.

The lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when we arrived. I could hear awful noises from behind the seal cutter's shop front, as if some one were groaning his soul out. Suddhoo shook all over, and while we groped our way upstairs told me that the jadoo had begun. Janoo and Azizun met us at the stair head, and told us that the jadoo work was coming off in their rooms, because there was more space there. Janoo is a lady of a freethinking turn of mind. She whispered that the jadoo was an invention to get money out of Suddhoo, and that the seal cutter would go to a hot place when he died. Suddhoo was nearly crying with fear and old age. He kept walking up and down the room in the half light, repeating his son's name over and over again, and asking Azizun if the seal cutter ought not to make a reduction in the case of his own landlord. Janoo pulled me over to the shadow in the recess of the carved bow-windows. The boards were up, and the rooms were only lit by one tiny oil lamp. There was no chance of my being seen if I stayed still.

Presently, the groans below ceased, and we heard steps on the staircase. That was the seal cutter. He stopped outside the door as the terrier barked and Azizun fumbled at the chain, and he told Suddhoo to blow out the lamp. This left the place in jet darkness, except for the red glow from the two huqas that belonged to Janoo and Azizun. The seal cutter came in, and I heard Suddhoo throw himself down on the floor and groan. Azizun caught her breath, and Janoo backed on to one of the beds with a shudder. There was a clink of something metallic, and then shot up a pale blue-green flame near the ground. The light was just enough to show Azizun, pressed against one corner of the room with the terrier between her knees; Janoo, with her hands clasped, leaning forward as she sat on the bed; Suddhoo, face down, quivering, and the seal cutter.

I hope I may never see another man like that seal cutter. He was stripped to the waist, with a wreath of white jasmine as thick as my wrist round his forehead, a salmon-colored loin-cloth round his middle, and a steel bangle on each ankle. This was not awe-inspiring. It was the face of the man that turned me cold. It was blue-gray in the first place. In the second, the eyes were rolled back till you could only see the whites of them; and, in the third, the face was the face of a demon—a ghoul—anything you please except of the sleek, oily old ruffian who sat in the daytime over his turning-lathe downstairs. He was lying on his stomach with his arms turned and crossed behind him, as if he had been thrown down pinioned. His head and neck were the only parts of him off the floor. They were nearly at right angles to the body, like the head of a cobra at spring. It was ghastly. In the center of the room, on the bare earth floor, stood a big, deep, brass basin, with a pale blue-green light floating in the center like a night-light. Round that basin the man on the floor wriggled himself three times. How he did it I do not know. I could see the muscles ripple along his spine and fall smooth again; but I could not see any other motion. The head seemed the only thing alive about him, except that slow curl and uncurl of the laboring back muscles. Janoo from the bed was breathing seventy to the minute; Azizun held her hands before her eyes; and old Suddhoo, fingering at the dirt that had got into his white beard, was crying to himself. The horror of it was that the creeping, crawly thing made no sound—only crawled! And, remember, this lasted for ten minutes, while the terrier whined, and Azizun shuddered, and Janoo gasped and Suddhoo cried.

I felt the hair lift at the back of my head, and my heart thump like a thermantidote paddle. Luckily, the seal cutter betrayed himself by his most impressive trick and made me calm again. After he had finished that unspeakable crawl, he stretched his head away from the floor as high as he could, and sent out a jet of fire from his nostrils. Now I knew how fire—spouting is done—I can do it myself—so I felt at ease. The business was a fraud. If he had only kept to that crawl without trying to raise the effect, goodness knows what I might not have thought. Both the girls shrieked at the jet of fire, and the head dropped, chin down on the floor, with a thud; the whole body lying then like a corpse with its arms trussed. There was a pause of five full minutes after this, and the blue-green flame died down. Janoo stooped to settle one of her anklets, while Azizun turned her face to the wall and took the terrier in her arms. Suddhoo put out an arm mechanically to Janoo's huqa, and she slid it across the floor with her foot. Directly above the body and on the wall were a couple of flaming portraits, in stamped paper frames, of the Queen and the Prince of Wales. They looked down on the performance, and, to my thinking, seemed to heighten the grotesqueness of it all.

Just when the silence was getting unendurable, the body turned over and rolled away from the basin to the side of the room, where it lay stomach up. There was a faint "plop" from the basin—exactly like the noise a fish makes when it takes a fly—and the green light in the center revived.

I looked at the basin, and saw, bobbing in the water the dried, shriveled, black head of a native baby—open eyes, open mouth and shaved scalp. It was worse, being so very sudden, than the crawling exhibition. We had no time to say anything before it began to speak.

Read Poe's account of the voice that came from the mesmerized dying man, and you will realize less than one half of the horror of that head's voice.

There was an interval of a second or two between each word, and a sort of "ring, ring, ring," in the note of the voice like the timbre of a bell. It pealed slowly, as if talking to itself, for several minutes before I got rid of my cold sweat. Then the blessed solution struck me. I looked at the body lying near the doorway, and saw, just where the hollow of the throat joins on the shoulders, a muscle that had nothing to do with any man's regular breathing, twitching away steadily. The whole thing was a careful reproduction of the Egyptian teraphin that one reads about sometimes; and the voice was as clever and as appalling a piece of ventriloquism as one could wish to hear. All this time the head was "lip-lip-lapping" against the side of the basin, and speaking. It told Suddhoo, on his face again whining, of his son's illness and of the state of the illness up to the evening of that very night. I always shall respect the seal cutter for keeping so faithfully to the time of the Peshawar telegrams. It went on to say that skilled doctors were night and day watching over the man's life; and that he would eventually recover if the fee to the potent sorcerer, whose servant was the head in the basin, were doubled.

Here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in. To ask for twice your stipulated fee in a voice that Lazarus might have used when he rose from the dead, is absurd. Janoo, who is really a woman of masculine intellect, saw this as quickly as I did. I heard her say "Ash nahin! Fareib!" scornfully under her breath; and just as she said so, the light in the basin died out, the head stopped talking, and we heard the room door creak on its hinges. Then Janoo struck a match, lit the lamp, and we saw that head, basin, and seal cutter were gone. Suddhoo was wringing his hands and explaining to anyone who cared to listen, that, if his chances of eternal salvation depended on it, he could not raise another two hundred rupees. Azizun was nearly in hysterics in the corner; while Janoo sat down composedly on one of the beds to discuss the probabilities of the whole thing being a bunao, or "make-up."

I explained as much as I knew of the seal cutter's way of jadoo; but her argument was much more simple:—"The magic that is always demanding gifts is no true magic," said she. "My mother told me that the only potent love spells are those which are told you for love. This seal cutter man is a liar and a devil. I dare not tell, do anything, or get anything done, because I am in debt to Bhagwan Dass the bunnia for two gold rings and a heavy anklet. I must get my food from his shop. The seal cutter is the friend of Bhagwan Dass, and he would poison my food. A fool's jadoo has been going on for ten days, and has cost Suddhoo many rupees each night. The seal cutter used black hens and lemons and mantras before. He never showed us anything like this till to-night. Azizun is a fool, and will be a pur dahnashin soon. Suddhoo has lost his strength and his wits. See now! I had hoped to get from Suddhoo many rupees while he lived, and many more after his death; and behold, he is spending everything on that offspring of a devil and a she-ass, the seal cutter!"

Here I said: "But what induced Suddhoo to drag me into the business? Of course I can speak to the seal cutter, and he shall refund. The whole thing is child's talk—shame—and senseless."

"Suddhoo is an old child," said Janoo. "He has lived on the roofs these seventy years and is as senseless as a milch goat. He brought you here to assure himself that he was not breaking any law of the Sirkar, whose salt he ate many years ago. He worships the dust off the feet of the seal cutter, and that cow devourer has forbidden him to go and see his son. What does Suddhoo know of your laws or the lightning post? I have to watch his money going day by day to that lying beast below."

Janoo stamped her foot on the floor and nearly cried with vexation; while Suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket in the corner, and Azizun was trying to guide the pipe-stem to his foolish old mouth.

Now the case stands thus. Unthinkingly, I have laid myself open to the charge of aiding and abetting the seal cutter in obtaining money under false pretenses, which is forbidden by Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. I am helpless in the matter for these reasons, I cannot inform the police. What witnesses would support my statements? Janoo refuses flatly, and Azizun is a veiled woman somewhere near Bareilly—lost in this big India of ours. I dare not again take the law into my own hands, and speak to the seal cutter; for certain am I that, not only would Suddhoo disbelieve me, but this step would end in the poisoning of Janoo, who is bound hand and foot by her debt to the bunnia. Suddhoo is an old dotard; and whenever we meet mumbles my idiotic joke that the Sirkar rather patronizes the Black Art than otherwise. His son is well now; but Suddhoo is completely under the influence of the seal cutter, by whose advice he regulates the affairs of his life. Janoo watches daily the money that she hoped to wheedle out of Suddhoo taken by the seal cutter, and becomes daily more furious and sullen.

She will never tell, because she dare not; but, unless something happens to prevent her, I am afraid that the seal cutter will die of cholera—the white arsenic kind—about the middle of May. And thus I shall have to be privy to a murder in the house of Suddhoo.

—Vibart's Moralities.

Shakespeare says something about worms, or it may be giants or beetles, turning if you tread on them too severely. The safest plan is never to tread on a worm—not even on the last new subaltern from Home, with his buttons hardly out of their tissue paper, and the red of sappy English beef in his cheeks. This is the story of the worm that turned. For the sake of brevity, we will call Henry Augustus Ramsay Faizanne, "The Worm," although he really was an exceedingly pretty boy, without a hair on his face, and with a waist like a girl's, when he came out to the Second "Shikarris" and was made unhappy in several ways. The "Shikarris" are a high-caste regiment, and you must be able to do things well—play a banjo, or ride more than little, or sing, or act—to get on with them.

The Worm did nothing except fall off his pony, and knock chips out of gate posts with his trap. Even that became monotonous after a time. He objected to whist, cut the cloth at billiards, sang out of tune, kept very much to himself, and wrote to his Mamma and sisters at Home. Four of these five things were vices which the "Shikarris" objected to and set themselves to eradicate. Everyone knows how subalterns are, by brother subalterns, softened and not permitted to be ferocious. It is good and wholesome, and does no one any harm, unless tempers are lost; and then there is trouble. There was a man once—but that is another story.

The "Shikarris" shikarred The Worm very much, and he bore everything without winking. He was so good and so anxious to learn, and flushed so pink, that his education was cut short, and he was left to his own devices by everyone except the Senior Subaltern who continued to make life a burden to The Worm. The Senior Subaltern meant no harm; but his chaff was coarse, and he didn't quite understand where to stop. He had been waiting too long for his Company; and that always sours a man. Also he was in love, which made him worse.

One day, after he had borrowed The Worm's trap for a lady who never existed, had used it himself all the afternoon, had sent a note to The Worm, purporting to come from the lady, and was telling the Mess all about it, The Worm rose in his place and said, in his quiet, ladylike voice:—"That was a very pretty sell; but I'll lay you a month's pay to a month's pay when you get your step, that I work a sell on you that you'll remember for the rest of your days, and the Regiment after you when you're dead or broke." The Worm wasn't angry in the least, and the rest of the Mess shouted. Then the Senior Subaltern looked at The Worm from the boots upward, and down again and said: "Done, Baby." The Worm took the rest of the Mess to witness that the bet had been taken, and retired into a book with a sweet smile.

Two months passed, and the Senior Subaltern still educated The Worm, who began to move about a little more as the hot weather came on. I have said that the Senior Subaltern was in love. The curious thing is that a girl was in love with the Senior Subaltern. Though the Colonel said awful things, and the Majors snorted, and married Captains looked unutterable wisdom, and the juniors scoffed, those two were engaged.

The Senior Subaltern was so pleased with getting his Company and his acceptance at the same time that he forgot to bother The Worm. The girl was a pretty girl, and had money of her own. She does not come into this story at all.

One night, at beginning of the hot weather, all the Mess, except The Worm who had gone to his own room to write Home letters, were sitting on the platform outside the Mess House. The Band had finished playing, but no one wanted to go in. And the Captains' wives were there also. The folly of a man in love is unlimited. The Senior Subaltern had been holding forth on the merits of the girl he was engaged to, and the ladies were purring approval, while the men yawned, when there was a rustle of skirts in the dark, and a tired, faint voice lifted itself.

"Where's my husband?"

I do not wish in the least to reflect on the morality of the "Shikarris"; but it is on record that four men jumped up as if they had been shot. Three of them were married men. Perhaps they were afraid that their wives had come from Home unbeknownst. The fourth said that he had acted on the impulse of the moment. He explained this afterwards.

Then the voice cried: "Oh Lionel!" Lionel was the Senior Subaltern's name. A woman came into the little circle of light by the candles on the peg tables, stretching out her hands to the dark where the Senior Subaltern was, and sobbing. We rose to our feet, feeling that things were going to happen and ready to believe the worst. In this bad, small world of ours, one knows so little of the life of the next man—which, after all, is entirely his own concern—that one is not surprised when a crash comes. Anything might turn up any day for anyone. Perhaps the Senior Subaltern had been trapped in his youth. Men are crippled that way occasionally. We didn't know; we wanted to hear; and the Captains' wives were as anxious as we. If he had been trapped, he was to be excused; for the woman from nowhere, in the dusty shoes and gray traveling dress, was very lovely, with black hair and great eyes full of tears. She was tall, with a fine figure, and her voice had a running sob in it pitiful to hear. As soon as the Senior Subaltern stood up, she threw her arms round his neck, and called him "my darling" and said she could not bear waiting alone in England, and his letters were so short and cold, and she was his to the end of the world, and would he forgive her? This did not sound quite like a lady's way of speaking. It was too demonstrative.

Things seemed black indeed, and the Captains' wives peered under their eyebrows at the Senior Subaltern, and the Colonel's face set like the Day of Judgment framed in gray bristles, and no one spoke for a while.

Next the Colonel said, very shortly: "Well, sir?" and the woman sobbed afresh. The Senior Subaltern was half choked with the arms round his neck, but he gasped out: "It's a d——d lie! I never had a wife in my life!" "Don't swear," said the Colonel. "Come into the Mess. We must sift this clear somehow," and he sighed to himself, for he believed in his "Shikarris," did the Colonel.

We trooped into the anteroom, under the full lights, and there we saw how beautiful the woman was. She stood up in the middle of us all, sometimes choking with crying, then hard and proud, and then holding out her arms to the Senior Subaltern. It was like the fourth act of a tragedy. She told us how the Senior Subaltern had married her when he was Home on leave eighteen months before; and she seemed to know all that we knew, and more too, of his people and his past life. He was white and ashy gray, trying now and again to break into the torrent of her words; and we, noting how lovely she was and what a criminal he looked, esteemed him a beast of the worst kind. We felt sorry for him, though.

I shall never forget the indictment of the Senior Subaltern by his wife. Nor will he. It was so sudden, rushing out of the dark, unannounced, into our dull lives. The Captains' wives stood back; but their eyes were alight, and you could see that they had already convicted and sentenced the Senior Subaltern. The Colonel seemed five years older. One Major was shading his eyes with his hand and watching the woman from underneath it. Another was chewing his mustache and smiling quietly as if he were witnessing a play. Full in the open space in the center, by the whist tables, the Senior Subaltern's terrier was hunting for fleas. I remember all this as clearly as though a photograph were in my hand. I remember the look of horror on the Senior Subaltern's face. It was rather like seeing a man hanged; but much more interesting. Finally, the woman wound up by saying that the Senior Subaltern carried a double F.M. in tattoo on his left shoulder. We all knew that, and to our innocent minds it seemed to clinch the matter. But one of the Bachelor Majors said very politely: "I presume that your marriage certificate would be more to the purpose?"

That roused the woman. She stood up and sneered at the Senior Subaltern for a cur, and abused the Major and the Colonel and all the rest. Then she wept, and then she pulled a paper from her breast, saying imperially: "Take that! And let my husband—my lawfully wedded husband—read it aloud—if he dare!"

There was a hush, and the men looked into each other's eyes as the Senior Subaltern came forward in a dazed and dizzy way, and took the paper. We were wondering, as we stared, whether there was anything against any one of us that might turn up later on. The Senior Subaltern's throat was dry; but, as he ran his eye over the paper, he broke out into a hoarse cackle of relief, and said to the woman: "You young blackguard!"

But the woman had fled through a door, and on the paper was written: "This is to certify that I, The Worm, have paid in full my debts to the Senior Subaltern, and, further, that the Senior Subaltern is my debtor, by agreement on the 23d of February, as by the Mess attested, to the extent of one month's Captain's pay, in the lawful currency of the India Empire."

Then a deputation set off for The Worm's quarters and found him, betwixt and between, unlacing his stays, with the hat, wig, serge dress, etc., on the bed. He came over as he was, and the "Shikarris" shouted till the Gunners' Mess sent over to know if they might have a share of the fun. I think we were all, except the Colonel and the Senior Subaltern, a little disappointed that the scandal had come to nothing. But that is human nature. There could be no two words about The Worm's acting. It leaned as near to a nasty tragedy as anything this side of a joke can. When most of the Subalterns sat upon him with sofa cushions to find out why he had not said that acting was his strong point, he answered very quietly: "I don't think you ever asked me. I used to act at Home with my sisters." But no acting with girls could account for The Worm's display that night. Personally, I think it was in bad taste. Besides being dangerous. There is no sort of use in playing with fire, even for fun.

The "Shikarris" made him President of the Regimental Dramatic Club; and, when the Senior Subaltern paid up his debt, which he did at once, The Worm sank the money in scenery and dresses. He was a good Worm; and the "Shikarris" are proud of him. The only drawback is that he has been christened "Mrs. Senior Subaltern"; and, as there are now two Mrs. Senior Subalterns in the Station, this is sometimes confusing to strangers.

Later on, I will tell you of a case something like this, but with all the jest left out and nothing in it but real trouble.
A. Conan Doyle
A Case of Identity

"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man can invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction, with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions, most stale and unprofitable."

"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."

"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."

I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so," I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here"—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the unsympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."

"Indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the paper, and glancing his eye down it. "This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story teller. Take a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."

He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the center of the lid. Its splendor was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.

"Ah!" said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia, in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."

"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.

"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."

"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.

"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any features of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime, the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."

He had risen from his chair, and was standing between the parted blinds, gazing down into the dull, neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess-of-Devonshire fashion over her ear.

From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.

"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man, she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."

As he spoke, there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchantman behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and having closed the door, and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.

"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?"

"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realizing the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start, and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humored face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing, "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"

"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easily when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger tips together, and his eyes to the ceiling.

Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my father—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing, and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."

"Your father?" said Holmes. "Your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."

"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."

"And your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes; mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveler in wines. They got four thousand seven hundred for the good-will and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."

I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"

"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate, and was left me by my Uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying four and half per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest."

"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little, and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about sixty pounds."

"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter, and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Doctor Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."

A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday School treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go, for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm; but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France, he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball?"

"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."

"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."

"No?"

"Well, you know, father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."

"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"

"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."

"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"

"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street—and—"

"What office?"

"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes; I don't know."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slept on the premises."

"And you don't know his address?"

"No—except that it was Leadenhall Street."

"Where did you address your letters, then?"

"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."

"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."

"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"

"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again, and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest, and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favor from the first, and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding."

"It missed him, then?"

"Yes, sir, for he had started to England just before it arrived."

"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us, he put us both into it, and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked, there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."

"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.

"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."

"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"

"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened."

"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"

"None."

"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"

"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."

"And your father? Did you tell him?"

"Yes, and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the door of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason; but Hosmer was very independent about money, and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh! it drives me half mad to think of, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff, and began to sob heavily into it.

"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."

"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"

"I fear not."

"Then what has happened to him?"

"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him, and any letters of his which you can spare."

"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip, and here are four letters from him."

"Thank you. And your address?"

"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."

"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?"

"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."

"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life."

"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."

For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table, and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his finger tips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counselor, and, having lighted it, he leaned back in his chair, with thick blue cloud wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.

"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive."

"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.

"Not invisible, but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."

"Well, she had a slate-colored, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewed upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee color, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were grayish, and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do, in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."

Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for color. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeve, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."

"It surprised me."

"But, surely, it was very obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones, the one having a slightly decorated toe cap and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."

"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.

"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home, but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not, apparently, see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry, and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

I held the little printed slip to the light. "Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five feet seven inches in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the center, bushy black side-whiskers and mustache; tinted glasses; slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and gray Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing," etc., etc.

"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clew in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."

"They are typewritten," I remarked.

"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it conclusive."

"Of what?"

"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"

"I cannot say that I do, unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted."

"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."

I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning, and extraordinary energy in action, that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanor with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and the Irene Adler photograph, but when I looked back to the weird business of the "Sign of the Four," and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the "Study in Scarlet," I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.

I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clews which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.

A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free, and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent, cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.

"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.

"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."

"No, no; the mystery!" I cried.

"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."

"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"

The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and a tap at the door.

"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!"

The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating gray eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top hat upon the sideboard, and, with a slight bow, sidled down into the nearest chair.

"Good evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"

"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"

"On the contrary," said Holmes, quietly, "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."

Mr. Windibank gave a violent start, and dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he said.

"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over the e, and a slight defect in the tail of the r. There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious."

"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.

"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the e's slurred and the r's tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."

Mr. Windibank sprung out of his chair, and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."

"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"

"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips, and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

"Oh, it won't do—really it won't," said Holmes, suavely. "There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down, and let us talk it over."

Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face, and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "It—it's not actionable," he stammered.

"I am very much afraid that it is not; but between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel, and selfish, and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."

The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece, and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.

"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home, and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife, he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a mustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."

"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would have been so carried away."

"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as if would go, if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning toward anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind, and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"

Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he; "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint."

"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to—" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.

"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."

"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I remarked.

"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognize even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."

"And how did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description, I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise,—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice,—and I sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travelers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address, asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten, and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employee, James Windibank. Voilà tout!"

"And Miss Sutherland?"

"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatcheth a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."
A Scandal in Bohemia
I

To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen; but as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing that a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centered interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention; while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clews, and clearing up those mysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings; of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

One night—it was on the 20th of March, 1888—I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lighted, and even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest, and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire, and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.

"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."

"Seven," I answered.

"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."

"Then how do you know?"

"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but as I have changed my clothes, I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there again I fail to see how you work it out."

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together.

"It is simplicity itself," said he, "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slicking specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms, smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he, explained his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process. And yet, I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."

"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"Frequently."

"How often?"

"Well, some hundreds of times."

"Then how many are there?"

"How many? I don't know."

"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick pink-tinted note paper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."

The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber, then, at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wears a mask."

"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?"

"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself—what do you deduce from it?"

I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.

"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavoring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."

"Peculiar—that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light"

I did so, and saw a large E with a small g, a P and a large G with a small t woven into the texture of the paper.

"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."

"Not all. The G with the small t stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' P, of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the Eg. Let us glance at our 'Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills.' Ha! ha! my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence—'This account of you we have from all quarters received'? A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."

"I think I had better go, Holmes."

"Not a bit, doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."

"But your client—"

"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, doctor, and give us your best attention."

A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.

"Come in!" said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and front of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-colored silk, and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheek-bones, a black visard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

"You had my note?" he asked, with a deep, harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Doctor Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honor to address?"

"You may address me as the Count von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honor and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."

The count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight that it may have an influence upon European history."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"And I."

"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own."

"I was aware of it," said Holmes, dryly.

"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal, and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."

"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair, and closing his eyes.

Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been, no doubt, depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

"If your majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."

The man sprung from his chair, and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.

"You are right," he cried, "I am the king. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"

"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia."

"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high, white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."

"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."

"Kindly look her up in my index, doctor," murmured Holmes, without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system for docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto—hum! La Scala—hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."

"Precisely so. But how—"

"Was there a secret marriage?"

"None."

"No legal papers or certificates?"

"None."

"Then I fail to follow your majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"

"There is the writing."

"Pooh-pooh! Forgery."

"My private note paper."

"Stolen."

"My own seal."

"Imitated."

"My photograph."

"Bought."

"We were both in the photograph."

"Oh, dear! That is very bad. Your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."

"I was mad—insane."

"You have compromised yourself seriously."

"I was only crown prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."

"It must be recovered."

"We have tried and failed."

"Your majesty must pay. It must be bought."

"She will not sell."

"Stolen, then."

"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she traveled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result."

"No sign of it?"

"Absolutely none."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.

"But a very serious one to me," returned the king, reproachfully.

"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?"

"To ruin me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be married."

"So I have heard."

"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."

"And Irene Adler?"

"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go—none."

"You are sure she has not sent it yet?"

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."

"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes, with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?"

"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham, under the name of the Count von Kramm."

"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."

"Pray do so; I shall be all anxiety."

"Then, as to money?"

"You have carte blanche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."

"And for present expenses?"

The king took a heavy chamois-leather bag from under his cloak, and laid it on the table.

"There are three hundred pounds in gold, and seven hundred in notes," he said.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook, and handed it to him.

"And mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he, thoughtfully. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"

"It was."

"Then, good-night, your majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three o'clock, I should like to chat this little matter over with you."
II

At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.

It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked, and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.

"What is it?"

"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and, perhaps, the house, of Miss Irene Adler."

"Quite so, but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in the front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.

"I then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the hostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and I received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighborhood, in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.

"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine Mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing; never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine Mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all that they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.

"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."

"I am following you closely," I answered.

"I was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprung out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and mustached—evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door, with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.

"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly. 'Drive like the devil!' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'

"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.

"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried; 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau, when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare; but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man, and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed, and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could toward me.

"'Thank God!' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

"'What then?' I asked.

"'Come, man, come; only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'

"I was half dragged up to the altar, and, before I knew where I was, I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license; that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion."

"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"

"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said, as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."

"Which are?"

"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, doctor, I shall want your cooperation."

"I shall be delighted."

"You don't mind breaking the law?"

"Not in the least."

"Nor running a chance of arrest?"

"Not in a good cause."

"Oh, the cause is excellent!"

"Then I am your man."

"I was sure that I might rely on you."

"But what is it you wish?"

"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

"And what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."

"Yes."

"And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?"

"Entirely."

"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long, cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end, to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"

"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and, at the signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street."

"Precisely."

"Then you may entirely rely on me."

"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepared for the new role I have to play."

He disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad, black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equaled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.

It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes's succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighborhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.

"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is—where are we to find the photograph?"

"Where, indeed?"

"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."

"Where, then?"

"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."

"But it has twice been burglarized."

"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."

"But how will you look?"

"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But she will refuse."

"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."

As he spoke, the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the center of a little knot of struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top, with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.

"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.

"He is dead," cried several voices.

"No, no, there's life in him," shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can get him to the hospital."

"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah! he's breathing now."

"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"

"Surely. Bring him into the sitting room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please." Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge, and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lighted, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.

Holmes had sat upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen, hostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room, and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd, I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which led toward the Edgeware Road.

"You did it very nicely, doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right."

"You have the photograph?"

"I know where it is."

"And how did you find out?"

"She showed me, as I told you that she would."

"I am still in the dark."

"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."

"I guessed as much."

"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."

"That also I could fathom."

"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."

"How did that help you?"

"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby—an unmarried one reaches for her jewel box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."

"And now?" I asked.

"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the king to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands."

"And when will you call?"

"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the king without delay."

We had reached Baker Street, and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key, when some one passing said:

"Good night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."

There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.

"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lighted street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been?"
III

I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning, when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.

"You have really got it?" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder, and looking eagerly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you have hopes?"

"I have hopes."

"Then come. I am all impatience to be gone."

"We must have a cab."

"No, my brougham is waiting."

"Then that will simplify matters." We descended, and started off once more for Briony Lodge.

"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.

"Married! When?"

"Yesterday."

"But to whom?"

"To an English lawyer named Norton."

"But she could not love him."

"I am in hopes that she does."

"And why in hopes?"

"Because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your majesty. If she does not love your majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your majesty's plan."

"It is true. And yet—Well, I wish she had been of my own station. What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.

The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.

"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning, with her husband, by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross, for the Continent."

"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise.

"Do you mean that she has left England?"

"Never to return."

"And the papers?" asked the king hoarsely. "All is lost!"

"We shall see." He pushed past the servant, and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the king and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves, and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress; the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night, and ran in this way:

"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of the fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the king employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.

"Well, I followed you to the door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.

"We both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, very truly yours,

"IRENE NORTON, née ADLER."

"What a woman—oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"

"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."

"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the king, "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."

"I am glad to hear your majesty say so."

"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring—" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger, and held it out upon the palm of his hand.

"Your majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.

"You have but to name it."

"This photograph!"

The king stared at him in amazement.

"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."

"I thank your majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honor to wish you a very good morning." He bowed, and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.

And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honorable title of the woman.
The Red-Headed League

I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.

"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said, cordially.

"I was afraid that you were engaged."

"So I am. Very much so."

"Then I can wait in the next room."

"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."

The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small, fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair, and putting his finger tips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."

"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.

"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."

"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."

"You did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you, until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledge me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you, not merely because my friend, Dr. Watson, has not heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."

The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward, and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man, and endeavored, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.

I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy gray shepherd's check trousers, a not overclean black frock coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes's quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"How, in the name of good fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did manual labor? It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."

"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it and the muscles are more developed."

"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"

"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc and compass breastpin."

"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"

"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk."

"Well, but China?"

"The fish which you have tattooed immediately above your wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks, and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch chain, the matter becomes even more simple."

Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all."

"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotom pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, I have got it now," he answered, with his thick, red finger planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."

I took the paper from him and read as follows:

"To the Red-headed League: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U.S.A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of four pounds a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."

"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated, after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.

Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, doctor, of the paper and the date."

"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago."

"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson."

"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead, "I have a small pawnbroker's business at Saxe-Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages, so as to learn the business."

"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself, and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employee who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault; but, on the whole, he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."

"He is still with you, I presume?"

"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking, and keeps the place clean—that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower, and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads, and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.

"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:

"'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'

"'Why that?' I asks.

"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change color here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and, as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

"'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked, with his eyes open.

"'Never.'

"'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.'

"'And what are they worth?' I asked.

"'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'

"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.

"'Tell me all about it,' said I.

"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that color. From all I hear it is splendid pay, and very little to do.'

"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'

"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is of no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real, bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'

"Now it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if there was to be any competition in the matter, I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.

"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the City to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of color they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office."

"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes, as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all. However, when our turn came, the little man was much more favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.

"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'

"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.

"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he, as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions, until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.

"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'

"I answered that I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

"'Dear me!' he said, gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'

"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over for a few minutes, he said that it would be all right.

"'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'

"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.

"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I shall be able to look after that for you.'

"'What would be the hours?' I asked.

"'Ten to two.'

"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evenings, which is just before pay day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.

"'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

"'Is four pounds a week.'

"'And the work?'

"'Is purely nominal.'

"'What do you call purely nominal?'

"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'

"'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.

"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross, 'neither sickness, nor business, nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'

"'And the work?'

"'Is to copy out the "Encyclopædia Britannica." There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'

"'Certainly,' I answered.

"'Then, good-by, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.

"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the 'Encyclopædia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bed time I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill pen and seven sheets of foolscap paper I started off for Pope's Court.

"Well, to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.

"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.

"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots, and Archery, and Armor, and Architecture, and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the Bs before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered onto the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."

He held up a piece of white cardboard, about the size of a sheet of note paper. It read in this fashion:

"THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED.
Oct. 9, 1890."

Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.

"'Well' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'

"'What, the red-headed man?'

"'Yes.'

"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor, and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

"'Where could I find him?'

"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."

"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."

"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some thirty pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."

"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two-and-thirty pounds."

"We shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?"

"About a month then."

"How did he come?"

"In answer to an advertisement."

"Was he the only applicant?"

"No, I had a dozen."

"Why did you pick him?"

"Because he was handy and would come cheap."

"At half wages, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"

"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?"

"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."

"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"

"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."

"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."

"Well, Watson," said Holmes, when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"

"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."

"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind, and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

"Sarasate plays at St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"

"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."

"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"

We traveled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy, two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in inclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass, and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with JABEZ WILSON in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.

"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand."

"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant, promptly, closing the door.

"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before."

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."

"Not him."

"What then?"

"The knees of his trousers."

"And what did you see?"

"What I expected to see."

"Why did you beat the pavement?"

"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."

The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which convey the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize, as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises, that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner, and glancing along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist; the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness, and delicacy, and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."

My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall, I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.

"You want to go home, no doubt, doctor," he remarked, as we emerged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Saxe-Coburg Square is serious."

"Why serious?"

"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be early enough."

"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."

"Very well. And, I say, doctor! there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.

I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened, but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the "Encyclopædia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.

It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the passage, I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognized as Peter Jones, the official police agent; while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock coat.

"Ha! our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket, and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."

"We're hunting in couples again, doctor, you see," said Jones, in his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him do the running down."

"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.

"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right!" said the stranger, with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."

"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some thirty thousand pounds; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a Royal Duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet."

"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."

Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive, and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into Farringdon Street.

"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog, and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us."

We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage, and through a side door which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.

"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked, as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.

"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet," said Holmes severely. "You have already imperiled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"

The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in his pocket.

"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."

"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."

"Your French gold?"

"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources, and borrowed, for that purpose, thirty thousand napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains two thousand napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."

"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes.

"And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime, Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."

"And sit in the dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and, though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm, unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourself behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."

I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern, and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault.

"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"

"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."

"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait."

What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards, it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position, yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier inbreath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the center of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark, which marked a chink between the stones.

Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side, and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.

"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"

Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes's hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.

"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly, "you have no chance at all."

"So I see," the other answered, with the utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."

"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.

"Oh, indeed. You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you."

"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."

"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness also, when you address me, always to say 'sir' and 'please.'"

"All right," said Jones, with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police station?"

"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery, that have ever come within my experience."

"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."

"You see, Watson," he explained, in the early hours of the morning, as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopædia,' must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but really it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the color of his accomplice's hair. The four pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."

"But how could you guess what the motive was?"

"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must then be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clew. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.

"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard, and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."

"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.

"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence; in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."

"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed, in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."

"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so."

"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I. He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien—l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to Georges Sands."
Egerton Castle
The Baron's Quarry

"Oh, no, I assure you, you are not boring Mr. Marshfield," said this personage himself in his gentle voice—that curious voice that could flow on for hours, promulgating profound and startling theories on every department of human knowledge or conducting paradoxical arguments without a single inflection or pause of hesitation. "I am, on the contrary, much interested in your hunting talk. To paraphrase a well-worn quotation somewhat widely, nihil humanum a me alienum est. Even hunting stories may have their point of biological interest; the philologist sometimes pricks his ear to the jargon of the chase; moreover, I am not incapable of appreciating the subject matter itself. This seems to excite some derision. I admit I am not much of a sportsman to look at, nor, indeed, by instinct, yet I have had some out-of-the-way experiences in that line—generally when intent on other pursuits. I doubt, for instance, if even you, Major Travers, notwithstanding your well-known exploits against man and beast, notwithstanding that doubtful smile of yours, could match the strangeness of a certain hunting adventure in which I played an important part."

The speaker's small, deep-set, black eyes, that never warmed to anything more human than a purely speculative scientific interest in his surroundings, here wandered round the skeptical yet expectant circle with bland amusement. He stretched out his bloodless fingers for another of his host's superfine cigars and proceeded, with only such interruptions as were occasioned by the lighting and careful smoking of the latter.

"I was returning home after my prolonged stay in Petersburg, intending to linger on my way and test with mine own ears certain among the many dialects of Eastern Europe—anent which there is a symmetrical little cluster of philological knotty points it is my modest intention one day to unravel. However, that is neither here nor there. On the road to Hungary I bethought myself opportunely of proving the once pressingly offered hospitality of the Baron Kossowski.

"You may have met the man, Major Travers; he was a tremendous sportsman, if you like. I first came across him at McNeil's place in remote Ireland. Now, being in Bukowina, within measurable distance of his Carpathian abode, and curious to see a Polish lord at home, I remembered his invitation. It was already of long standing, but it had been warm, born in fact of a sudden fit of enthusiasm for me"—here a half-mocking smile quivered an instant under the speaker's black mustache—"which, as it was characteristic, I may as well tell you about.

"It was on the day of, or, rather, to be accurate, on the day after my arrival, toward the small hours of the morning, in the smoking room at Rathdrum. Our host was peacefully snoring over his empty pipe and his seventh glass of whisky, also empty. The rest of the men had slunk off to bed. The baron, who all unknown to himself had been a subject of most interesting observation to me the whole evening, being now practically alone with me, condescended to turn an eye, as wide awake as a fox's, albeit slightly bloodshot, upon the contemptible white-faced person who had preferred spending the raw hours over his papers, within the radius of a glorious fire's warmth, to creeping slyly over treacherous quagmires in the pursuit of timid bog creatures (snipe shooting had been the order of the day)-the baron, I say, became aware of my existence and entered into conversation with me.

"He would no doubt have been much surprised could he have known that he was already mapped out, craniologically and physiognomically, catalogued with care and neatly laid by in his proper ethnological box, in my private type museum; that, as I sat and examined him from my different coigns of vantage in library, in dining and smoking room that evening, not a look of his, not a gesture went forth but had significance for me.

"You, I had thought, with your broad shoulders and deep chest; your massive head that should have gone with a tall stature, not with those short sturdy limbs; with your thick red hair, that should have been black for that matter, as should your wide-set yellow eyes—you would be a real puzzle to one who did not recognize in you equal mixtures of the fair, stalwart and muscular Slav with the bilious-sanguine, thick-set, wiry Turanian. Your pedigree would no doubt bear me out: there is as much of the Magyar as of the Pole in your anatomy. Athlete, and yet a tangle of nerves; a ferocious brute at bottom, I dare say, for your broad forehead inclines to flatness; under your bristling beard your jaw must protrude, and the base of your skull is ominously thick. And, with all that, capable of ideal transports: when that girl played and sang to-night I saw the swelling of your eyelid veins, and how that small, tenacious, claw-like hand of yours twitched! You would be a fine leader of men—but God help the wretches in your power!

"So had I mused upon him. Yet I confess that when we came in closer contact with each other, even I was not proof against the singular courtesy of his manner and his unaccountable personal charm.

"Our conversation soon grew interesting; to me as a matter of course, and evidently to him also. A few general words led to interchange of remarks upon the country we were both visitors in and so to national characteristics—Pole and Irishman have not a few in common, both in their nature and history. An observation which he made, not without a certain flash in his light eyes and a transient uncovering of the teeth, on the Irish type of female beauty suddenly suggested to me a stanza of an ancient Polish ballad, very full of milk-and-blood imagery, of alternating ferocity and voluptuousness. This I quoted to the astounded foreigner in the vernacular, and this it was that metamorphosed his mere perfection of civility into sudden warmth, and, in fact, procured me the invitation in question.

"When I left Rathdrum the baron's last words to me were that if I ever thought of visiting his country otherwise than in books, he held me bound to make Yany, his Galician seat, my headquarters of study.

"From Czernowicz, therefore, where I stopped some time, I wrote, received in due time a few lines of prettily worded reply, and ultimately entered my sled in the nearest town to, yet at a most forbidding distance from, Yany, and started on my journey thither.

"The undertaking meant many long hours of undulation and skidding over the November snow, to the somniferous bell jangle of my dirty little horses, the only impression of interest being a weird gypsy concert I came in for at a miserable drinking-booth half buried in the snow where we halted for the refreshment of man and beast. Here, I remember, I discovered a very definite connection between the characteristic run of the tsimbol, the peculiar bite of the Zigeuner's bow on his fiddle-string, and some distinctive points of Turanian tongues. In other countries, in Spain, for instance, your gypsy speaks differently on his instrument. But, oddly enough, when I later attempted to put this observation on paper I could find no word to express it."

A few of our company evinced signs of sleepiness, but most of us who knew Marshfield, and that he could, unless he had something novel to say, be as silent and retiring as he now evinced signs of being copious, awaited further developments with patience. He has his own deliberate way of speaking, which he evidently enjoys greatly, though it be occasionally trying to his listeners.

"On the afternoon of my second day's drive, the snow, which till then had fallen fine and continuous, ceased, and my Jehu, suddenly interrupting himself in the midst of some exciting wolf story quite in keeping with the time of year and the wild surroundings, pointed to a distant spot against the gray sky to the northwest, between two wood-covered folds of ground—the first eastern spurs of the great Carpathian chain.

"'There stands Yany,' said he. I looked at my far-off goal with interest. As we drew nearer, the sinking sun, just dipping behind the hills, tinged the now distinct frontage with a cold copper-like gleam, but it was only for a minute; the next the building became nothing more to the eye than a black irregular silhouette against the crimson sky.

"Before we entered the long, steep avenue of poplars, the early winter darkness was upon us, rendered all the more depressing by gray mists which gave a ghostly aspect to such objects as the sheen of the snow rendered visible. Once or twice there were feeble flashes of light looming in iridescent halos as we passed little clusters of hovels, but for which I should have been induced to fancy that the great Hof stood alone in the wilderness, such was the deathly stillness around. But even as the tall, square building rose before us above the vapor, yellow lighted in various stories, and mighty in height and breadth, there broke upon my ear a deep-mouthed, menacing bay, which gave at once almost alarming reality to the eerie surroundings. 'His lordship's boar and wolf hounds,' quoth my charioteer calmly, unmindful of the regular pandemonium, of howls and barks which ensued as he skillfully turned his horses through the gateway and flogged the tired beasts into a sort of shambling canter that we might land with glory before the house door: a weakness common, I believe, to drivers of all nations.

"I alighted in the court of honor, and while awaiting an answer to my tug at the bell, stood, broken with fatigue, depressed, chilled and aching, questioning the wisdom of my proceedings and the amount of comfort, physical and moral, that was likely to await me in a tête-à-tête visit with a well-mannered savage in his own home.

"The unkempt tribe of stable retainers who began to gather round me and my rough vehicle in the gloom, with their evil-smelling sheepskins and their resigned, battered visages, were not calculated to reassure me. Yet when the door opened, there stood a smart chasseur and a solemn major-domo who might but just have stepped out of Mayfair; and there was displayed a spreading vista of warm, deep-colored halls, with here a statue and there a stuffed bear, and under foot pile carpets strewn with rarest skins.

"Marveling, yet comforted withal, I followed the solemn butler, who received me with the deference due to an expected guest and expressed the master's regret for his enforced absence till dinner time. I traversed vast rooms, each more sumptuous than the last, feeling the strangeness of the contrast between the outer desolation and this sybaritic excess of luxury growing ever more strongly upon me; caught a glimpse of a picture gallery, where peculiar yet admirably executed latter-day French pictures hung side by side with ferocious boar hunts of Snyder and such kin; and, at length, was ushered into a most cheerful room, modern to excess in its comfortable promise, where, in addition to the tall stove necessary for warmth, there burned on an open hearth a vastly pleasant fire of resinous logs, and where, on a low table, awaited me a dainty service of fragrant Russian tea.

"My impression of utter novelty seemed somehow enhanced by this unexpected refinement in the heart of the solitudes and in such a rugged shell, and yet, when I came to reflect, it was only characteristic of my cosmopolitan host. But another surprise was in store for me.

"When I had recovered bodily warmth and mental equilibrium in my downy armchair, before the roaring logs, and during the delicious absorption of my second glass of tea, I turned my attention to the French valet, evidently the baron's own man, who was deftly unpacking my portmanteau, and who, unless my practiced eye deceived me, asked for nothing better than to entertain me with agreeable conversation the while.

"'Your master is out, then?' quoth I, knowing that the most trivial remark would suffice to start him.

"True, Monseigneur was out; he was desolated in despair (this with the national amiable and imaginative instinct); 'but it was doubtless important business. M. le Baron had the visit of his factor during the midday meal; had left the table hurriedly, and had not been seen since. Madame la Baronne had been a little suffering, but she would receive monsieur!'

"'Madame!' exclaimed I, astounded, 'is your master then married?—since when?'—visions of a fair Tartar, fit mate for my baron, immediately springing somewhat alluringly before my mental vision. But the answer dispelled the picturesque fancy.

"'Oh, yes,' said the man, with a somewhat peculiar expression. 'Yes, Monseigneur is married. Did Monsieur not know? And yet it was from England that Monseigneur brought back his wife.'

"'An Englishwoman!'

"My first thought was one of pity; an Englishwoman alone in this wilderness—two days' drive from even a railway station—and at the mercy of Kossowski! But the next minute I reversed my judgment. Probably she adored her rufous lord, took his veneer of courtesy—a veneer of the most exquisite polish, I grant you, but perilously thin—for the very perfection of chivalry. Or perchance it was his inner savageness itself that charmed her; the most refined women often amaze one by the fascination which the preponderance of the brute in the opposite sex seems to have for them.

"I was anxious to hear more.

"'Is it not dull for the lady here at this time of the year?'

"The valet raised his shoulders with a gesture of despair that was almost passionate.

"Dull! Ah, monsieur could not conceive to himself the dullness of it. That poor Madame la Baronne! not even a little child to keep her company on the long, long days when there was nothing but snow in the heaven and on the earth and the howling of the wind and the dogs to cheer her. At the beginning, indeed, it had been different; when the master first brought home his bride the house was gay enough. It was all redecorated and refurnished to receive her (monsieur should have seen it before, a mere rendezvous-de-chasse—for the matter of that so were all the country houses in these parts). Ah, that was the good time! There were visits month after month; parties, sleighing, dancing, trips to St. Petersburg and Vienna. But this year it seemed they were to have nothing but boars and wolves. How madame could stand it—well, it was not for him to speak—and heaving a deep sigh he delicately inserted my white tie round my collar, and with a flourish twisted it into an irreproachable bow beneath my chin. I did not think it right to cross-examine the willing talker any further, especially as, despite his last asseveration, there were evidently volumes he still wished to pour forth; but I confess that, as I made my way slowly out of my room along the noiseless length of passage, I was conscious of an unwonted, not to say vulgar, curiosity concerning the woman who had captivated such a man as the Baron Kossowski.

"In a fit of speculative abstraction I must have taken the wrong turning, for I presently found myself in a long, narrow passage. I did not remember. I was retracing my steps when there came the sound of rapid footfalls upon stone flags; a little door flew open in the wall close to me, and a small, thick-set man, huddled in the rough sheepskin of the Galician peasant, with a mangy fur cap on his head, nearly ran headlong into my arms. I was about condescendingly to interpellate him in my best Polish, when I caught the gleam of an angry yellow eye and noted the bristle of a red beard—Kossowski!

"Amazed, I fell back a step in silence. With a growl like an uncouth animal disturbed, he drew his filthy cap over his brow with a savage gesture and pursued his way down the corridor at a sort of wild-boar trot.

"This first meeting between host and guest was so odd, so incongruous, that it afforded me plenty of food for a fresh line of conjecture as I traced my way back to the picture gallery, and from thence successfully to the drawing room, which, as the door was ajar, I could not this time mistake.

"It was large and lofty and dimly lit by shaded lamps; through the rosy gloom I could at first only just make out a slender figure by the hearth; but as I advanced, this was resolved into a singularly graceful woman in clinging, fur-trimmed velvet gown, who, with one hand resting on the high mantelpiece, the other hanging listlessly by her side, stood gazing down at the crumbling wood fire as if in a dream.

"My friends are kind enough to say that I have a cat-like tread; I know not how that may be; at any rate the carpet I was walking upon was thick enough to smother a heavier footfall: not until I was quite close to her did my hostess become aware of my presence. Then she started violently and looked over her shoulder at me with dilating eyes. Evidently a nervous creature, I saw the pulse in her throat, strained by her attitude, flutter like a terrified bird.

"The next instant she had stretched out her hand with sweet English words of welcome, and the face, which I had been comparing in my mind to that of Guido's Cenci, became transformed by the arch and exquisite smile of a Greuse. For more than two years I had had no intercourse with any of my nationality. I could conceive the sound of his native tongue under such circumstances moving a man in a curious unexpected fashion.

"I babbled some commonplace reply, after which there was silence while we stood opposite each other, she looking at me expectantly. At length, with a sigh checked by a smile and an overtone of sadness in a voice that yet tried to be sprightly:

"'Am I then so changed, Mr. Marshfield?' she asked. And all at once I knew her: the girl whose nightingale throat had redeemed the desolation of the evenings at Rathdrum, whose sunny beauty had seemed (even to my celebrated cold-blooded æstheticism) worthy to haunt a man's dreams. Yes, there was the subtle curve of the waist, the warm line of throat, the dainty foot, the slender tip-tilted fingers—witty fingers, as I had classified them—which I now shook like a true Briton, instead of availing myself of the privilege the country gave me, and kissing her slender wrist.

"But she was changed; and I told her so with unconventional frankness, studying her closely as I spoke.

"'I am afraid,' I said gravely, 'that this place does not agree with you.'

"She shrank from my scrutiny with a nervous movement and flushed to the roots of her red-brown hair. Then she answered coldly that I was wrong, that she was in excellent health, but that she could not expect any more than other people to preserve perennial youth (I rapidly calculated she might be two-and-twenty), though, indeed, with a little forced laugh, it was scarcely flattering to hear one had altered out of all recognition. Then, without allowing me time to reply, she plunged into a general topic of conversation which, as I should have been obtuse indeed not to take the hint, I did my best to keep up.

"But while she talked of Vienna and Warsaw, of her distant neighbors, and last year's visitors, it was evident that her mind was elsewhere; her eye wandered, she lost the thread of her discourse, answered me at random, and smiled her piteous smile incongruously.

"However lonely she might be in her solitary splendor, the company of a countryman was evidently no such welcome diversion.

"After a little while she seemed to feel herself that she was lacking in cordiality, and, bringing her absent gaze to bear upon me with a puzzled strained look: 'I fear you will find it very dull,' she said, 'my husband is so wrapped up this winter in his country life and his sport. You are the first visitor we have had. There is nothing but guns and horses here, and you do not care for these things.'

"The door creaked behind us; and the baron entered, in faultless evening dress. Before she turned toward him I was sharp enough to catch again the upleaping of a quick dread in her eyes, not even so much dread perhaps, I thought afterwards, as horror—the horror we notice in some animals at the nearing of a beast of prey. It was gone in a second, and she was smiling. But it was a revelation.

"Perhaps he beat her in Russian fashion, and she, as an Englishwoman, was narrow-minded enough to resent this; or perhaps, merely, I had the misfortune to arrive during a matrimonial misunderstanding.

"The baron would not give me leisure to reflect; he was so very effusive in his greeting—not a hint of our previous meeting—unlike my hostess, all in all to me; eager to listen, to reply; almost affectionate, full of references to old times and genial allusions. No doubt when he chose he could be the most charming of men; there were moments when, looking at him in his quiet smile and restrained gesture, the almost exaggerated politeness of his manner to his wife, whose fingers he had kissed with pretty, old-fashioned gallantry upon his entrance, I asked myself, Could that encounter in the passage have been a dream? Could that savage in the sheepskin be my courteous entertainer?

"Just as I came in, did I hear my wife say there was nothing for you to do in this place?" he said presently to me. Then, turning to her:

"You do not seem to know Mr. Marshfield. Wherever he can open his eyes there is for him something to see which might not interest other men. He will find things in my library which I have no notion of. He will discover objects for scientific observation in all the members of my household, not only in the good-looking maids—though he could, I have no doubt, tell their points as I could those of a horse. We have maidens here of several distinct races, Marshfield. We have also witches, and Jew leeches, and holy daft people. In any case, Yany, with all its dependencies, material, male and female, are at your disposal, for what you can make out of them.

"'It is good," he went on gayly, 'that you should happen to have this happy disposition, for I fear that, no later than to-morrow, I may have to absent myself from home. I have heard that there are news of wolves—they threaten to be a greater pest than usual this winter, but I am going to drive them on quite a new plan, and it will go hard with me if I don't come even with them. Well for you, by the way, Marshfield, that you did not pass within their scent to-day.' Then, musingly: 'I should not give much for the life of a traveler who happened to wander in these parts just now.' Here he interrupted himself hastily and went over to his wife, who had sunk back on her chair, livid, seemingly on the point of swooning.

"His gaze was devouring; so might a man look at the woman he adored, in his anxiety.

"'What! faint, Violet, alarmed!' His voice was subdued, yet there was an unmistakable thrill of emotion in it.

"'Pshaw!' thought I to myself, 'the man is a model husband.'

"She clinched her hands, and by sheer force of will seemed to pull herself together. These nervous women have often an unexpected fund of strength.

"'Come, that is well,' said the baron with a flickering smile; 'Mr. Marshfield will think you but badly acclimatized to Poland if a little wolf scare can upset you. My dear wife is so soft-hearted,' he went on to me, 'that she is capable of making herself quite ill over the sad fate that might have, but has not, overcome you. Or, perhaps,' he added, in a still gentler voice, 'her fear is that I may expose myself to danger for the public weal.'

"She turned her head away, but I saw her set her teeth as if to choke a sob. The baron chuckled in his throat and seemed to luxuriate in the pleasant thought.

"At this moment folding doors were thrown open, and supper was announced. I offered my arm, she rose and took it in silence. This silence she maintained during the first part of the meal, despite her husband's brilliant conversation and almost uproarious spirits. But by and by a bright color mounted to her cheeks and luster to her eyes. I suppose you will think me horribly unpoetical if I add that she drank several glasses of champagne one after the other, a fact which perhaps may account for the change.

"At any rate she spoke and laughed and looked lovely, and I did not wonder that the baron could hardly keep his eyes off her. But whether it was her wifely anxiety or not—it was evident her mind was not at ease through it all, and I fancied that her brightness was feverish, her merriment slightly hysterical.

"After supper—an exquisite one it was—we adjourned together, in foreign fashion, to the drawing-room; the baron threw himself into a chair and, somewhat with the air of a pasha, demanded music. He was flushed; the veins of his forehead were swollen and stood out like cords; the wine drunk at table was potent: even through my phlegmatic frame it ran hotly.

"She hesitated a moment or two, then docilely sat down to the piano. That she could sing I have already made clear: how she could sing, with what pathos, passion, as well as perfect art, I had never realized before.

"When the song was ended she remained for a while, with eyes lost in distance, very still, save for her quick breathing. It was clear she was moved by the music; indeed she must have thrown her whole soul into it.

"At first we, the audience, paid her the rare compliment of silence. Then the baron broke forth into loud applause. 'Brava, brava! that was really said con amore. A delicious love song, delicious—but French! You must sing one of our Slav melodies for Marshfield before you allow us to go and smoke.'

"She started from her reverie with a flush, and after a pause struck slowly a few simple chords, then began one of those strangely sweet, yet intensely pathetic Russian airs, which give one a curious revelation of the profound, endless melancholy lurking in the national mind.

"'What do you think of it?' asked the baron of me when it ceased.

"'What I have always thought of such music—it is that of a hopeless people; poetical, crushed, and resigned.'

"He gave a loud laugh. 'Hear the analyst, the psychologue—why, man, it is a love song! Is it possible that we, uncivilized, are truer realists than our hypercultured Western neighbors? Have we gone to the root of the matter, in our simple way?'

"The baroness got up abruptly. She looked white and spent; there were bister circles round her eyes.

"'I am tired,' she said, with dry lips. 'You will excuse me, Mr. Marshfield, I must really go to bed.'

"'Go to bed, go to bed,' cried her husband gayly. Then, quoting in Russian from the song she had just sung: 'Sleep, my little soft white dove: my little innocent tender lamb!' She hurried from the room. The baron laughed again, and, taking me familiarly by the arm, led me to his own set of apartments for the promised smoke. He ensconced me in an armchair, placed cigars of every description and a Turkish pipe ready to my hand, and a little table on which stood cut-glass flasks and beakers in tempting array.

"After I had selected my cigar with some precautions, I glanced at him over a careless remark, and was startled to see a sudden alteration in his whole look and attitude.

"'You will forgive me, Marshfield,' he said, as he caught my eye, speaking with spasmodic politeness. 'It is more than probable that I shall have to set out upon this chase I spoke of to-night, and I must now go and change my clothes, that I may be ready to start at any moment. This is the hour when it is most likely these hell beasts are to be got at. You have all you want, I hope,' interrupting an outbreak of ferocity by an effort after his former courtesy.

"It was curious to watch the man of the world struggling with the primitive man.

"'But, baron,' said I, 'I do not at all see the fun of sticking at home like this. You know my passion for witnessing everything new, strange, and outlandish. You will surely not refuse me such an opportunity for observation as a midnight wolf raid. I will do my best not to be in the way if you will take me with you.'

"At first it seemed as if he had some difficulty in realizing the drift of my words, he was so engrossed by some inner thought. But as I repeated them, he gave vent to a loud cachinnation.

"'By heaven! I like your spirit,' he exclaimed, clapping me strongly on the shoulder. 'Of course you shall come. You shall,' he repeated, 'and I promise you a sight, a hunt such as you never heard or dreamed of—you will be able to tell them in England the sort of thing we can do here in that line—such wolves are rare quarry,' he added, looking slyly at me, 'and I have a new plan for getting at them.'

"There was a long pause, and then there rose in the stillness the unearthly howling of the baron's hounds, a cheerful sound which only their owner's somewhat loud converse of the evening had kept from becoming excessively obtrusive.

"'Hark at them—the beauties!' cried he, showing his short, strong teeth, pointed like a dog's in a wide grin of anticipative delight. 'They have been kept on pretty short commons, poor things! They are hungry. By the way, Marshfield, you can sit tight to a horse, I trust? If you were to roll off, you know, these splendid fellows—they would chop you up in a second. They would chop you up,' he repeated unctuously, 'snap, crunch, gobble, and there would be an end of you!'

"'If I could not ride a decent horse without being thrown,' I retorted, a little stung by his manner, 'after my recent three months' torture with the Guard Cossacks, I should indeed be a hopeless subject. Do not think of frightening me from the exploit, but say frankly if my company would be displeasing.'

"'Tut!' he said, waving his hand impatiently, 'it is your affair. I have warned you. Go and get ready if you want to come. Time presses.'

"I was determined to be of the fray; my blood was up. I have hinted that the baron's Tokay had stirred it.

"I went to my room and hurriedly donned clothes more suitable for rough night work. My last care was to slip into my pockets a brace of double-barreled pistols which formed part of my traveling kit. When I returned I found the baron already booted and spurred; this without metaphor. He was stretched full length on the divan, and did not speak as I came in, or even look at me. Chewing an unlit cigar, with eyes fixed on the ceiling, he was evidently following some absorbing train of ideas.

"The silence was profound; time went by; it grew oppressive; at length, wearied out, I fell, over my chibouque, into a doze filled with puzzling visions, out of which I was awakened with a start. My companion had sprung up, very lightly, to his feet. In his throat was an odd, half-suppressed cry, grewsome to hear. He stood on tiptoe, with eyes fixed, as though looking through the wall, and I distinctly saw his ears point in the intensity of his listening.

"After a moment, with hasty, noiseless energy, and without the slightest ceremony, he blew the lamps out, drew back the heavy curtains and threw the tall window wide open. A rush of icy air, and the bright rays of the moon—gibbous, I remember, in her third quarter—filled the room. Outside the mist had condensed, and the view was unrestricted over the white plains at the foot of the hill.

"The baron stood motionless in the open window, callous to the cold in which, after a minute, I could hardly keep my teeth from chattering, his head bent forward, still listening. I listened too, with 'all my ears,' but could not catch a sound; indeed the silence over the great expanse of snow might have been called awful; even the dogs were mute.

"Presently, far, far away, came a faint tinkle of bells; so faint, at first, that I thought it was but fancy, then distincter. It was even more eerie than the silence, I thought, though I knew it could come but from some passing sleigh. All at once that ceased, and again my duller senses could perceive nothing, though I saw by my host's craning neck that he was more on the alert than ever. But at last I too heard once more, this time not bells, but as it were the tread of horses muffled by the snow, intermittent and dull, yet drawing nearer. And then in the inner silence of the great house it seemed to me I caught the noise of closing doors; but here the hounds, as if suddenly becoming alive to some disturbance, raised the same fearsome concert of yells and barks with which they had greeted my arrival, and listening became useless.

"I had risen to my feet. My host, turning from the window, seized my shoulder with a fierce grip, and bade me 'hold my noise'; for a second or two I stood motionless under his iron talons, then he released me with an exultant whisper: "Now for our chase!" and made for the door with a spring. Hastily gulping down a mouthful of arrack from one of the bottles on the table, I followed him, and, guided by the sound of his footsteps before me, groped my way through passages as black as Erebus.

"After a time, which seemed a long one, a small door was flung open in front, and I saw Kossowski glide into the moonlit courtyard and cross the square. When I too came out he was disappearing into the gaping darkness of the open stable door, and there I overtook him.

"A man who seemed to have been sleeping in a corner jumped up at our entrance, and led out a horse ready saddled. In obedience to a gruff order from his master, as the latter mounted, he then brought forward another which he had evidently thought to ride himself and held the stirrup for me.

"We came delicately forth, and the Cossack hurriedly barred the great door behind us. I caught a glimpse of his worn, scarred face by the moonlight, as he peeped after us for a second before shutting himself in; it was stricken with terror.

"The baron trotted briskly toward the kennels, from whence there was now issuing a truly infernal clangor, and, as my steed followed suit of his own accord, I could see how he proceeded dexterously to unbolt the gates without dismounting, while the beasts within dashed themselves against them and tore the ground in their fury of impatience.

"He smiled, as he swung back the barriers at last, and his 'beauties' came forth. Seven or eight monstrous brutes, hounds of a kind unknown to me: fulvous and sleek of coat, tall on their legs, square-headed, long-tailed, deep-chested; with terrible jaws slobbering in eagerness. They leaped around and up at us, much to our horses' distaste. Kossowski, still smiling, lashed at them unsparingly with his hunting whip, and they responded, not with yells of pain, but with snarls of fury.

"Managing his restless steed and his cruel whip with consummate ease, my host drove the unruly crew before him out of the precincts, then halted and bent down from his saddle to examine some slight prints in the snow which led, not the way I had come, but toward what seemed another avenue. In a second or two the hounds were gathered round this spot, their great snake-like tails quivering, nose to earth, yelping with excitement. I had some ado to manage my horse, and my eyesight was far from being as keen as the baron's, but I had then no doubt he had come already upon wolf tracks, and I shuddered mentally, thinking of the sleigh bells.

"Suddenly Kossowski raised himself from his strained position; under his low fur cap his face, with its fixed smile, looked scarcely human in the white light: and then we broke into a hand canter just as the hounds dashed, in a compact body, along the trail.

"But we had not gone more than a few hundred yards before they began to falter, then straggled, stopped and ran back and about with dismal cries. It was clear to me they had lost the scent. My companion reined in his horse, and mine, luckily a well-trained brute, halted of himself.

"We had reached a bend in a broad avenue of firs and larches, and just where we stood, and where the hounds ever returned and met nose to nose in frantic conclave, the snow was trampled and soiled, and a little farther on planed in a great sweep, as if by a turning sleigh. Beyond was a double-furrowed track of skaits and regular hoof prints leading far away.

"Before I had time to reflect upon the bearing of this unexpected interruption, Kossowski, as if suddenly possessed by a devil, fell upon the hounds with his whip, flogging them upon the new track, uttering the while the most savage cries I have ever heard issue from human throat. The disappointed beasts were nothing loath to seize upon another trail; after a second of hesitation they had understood, and were off upon it at a tearing pace, we after them at the best speed of our horses.

"Some unformed idea that we were going to escort, or rescue, benighted travelers flickered dimly in my mind as I galloped through the night air; but when I managed to approach my companion and called out to him for explanation, he only turned half round and grinned at me.

"Before us lay now the white plain, scintillating under the high moon's rays. That light is deceptive; I could be sure of nothing upon the wide expanse but of the dark, leaping figures of the hounds already spread out in a straggling line, some right ahead, others just in front of us. In a short time also the icy wind, cutting my face mercilessly as we increased our pace, well nigh blinded me with tears of cold.

"I can hardly realize how long this pursuit after an unseen prey lasted; I can only remember that I was getting rather faint with fatigue, and ignominiously held on to my pommel, when all of a sudden the black outline of a sleigh merged into sight in front of us.

"I rubbed my smarting eyes with my benumbed hand; we were gaining upon it second by second; two of those hell hounds of the baron's were already within a few leaps of it.

"Soon I was able to make out two figures, one standing up and urging the horses on with whip and voice, the other clinging to the back seat and looking toward us in an attitude of terror. A great fear crept into my half-frozen brain—were we not bringing deadly danger instead of help to these travelers? Great God! did the baron mean to use them as a bait for his new method of wolf hunting?

"I would have turned upon Kossowski with a cry of expostulation or warning, but he, urging on his hounds as he galloped on their flank, howling and gesticulating like a veritable Hun, passed me by like a flash—and all at once I knew."

Marshfield paused for a moment and sent his pale smile round upon his listeners, who now showed no signs of sleepiness; he knocked the ash from his cigar, twisted the latter round in his mouth, and added dryly:

"And I confess it seemed to me a little strong even for a baron in the Carpathians. The travelers were our quarry. But the reason why the Lord of Yany had turned man-hunter I was yet to learn. Just then I had to direct my energies to frustrating his plans. I used my spurs mercilessly. While I drew up even with him I saw the two figures in the sleigh change places; he who had hitherto driven now faced back, while his companion took the reins, there was the pale blue sheen of a revolver barrel under the moonlight, followed by a yellow flash, and the nearest hound rolled over in the snow.

"With an oath the baron twisted round in his saddle to call up and urge on the remainder. My horse had taken fright at the report and dashed irresistibly forward, bringing me at once almost level with the fugitives, and the next instant the revolver was turned menacingly toward me. There was no time to explain; my pistol was already drawn, and as another of the brutes bounded up, almost under my horse's feet, I loosed it upon him. I must have let off both barrels at once, for the weapon flew out of my hand, but the hound's back was broken. I presume the traveler understood; at any rate, he did not fire at me.

"In moments of intense excitement like these, strangely enough, the mind is extraordinarily open to impressions. I shall never forget that man's countenance in the sledge, as he stood upright and defied us in his mortal danger; it was young, very handsome, the features not distorted, but set into a sort of desperate, stony calm, and I knew it, beyond all doubt, for that of an Englishman. And then I saw his companion—it was the baron's wife. And I understood why the bells had been removed.

"It takes a long time to say this; it only required an instant to see it. The loud explosion of my pistol had hardly ceased to ring before the baron, with a fearful imprecation, was upon me. First he lashed at me with his whip as we tore along side by side, and then I saw him wind the reins round his off arm and bend over, and I felt his angry fingers close tightly on my right foot. The next instant I should have been lifted out of my saddle, but there came another shot from the sledge. The baron's horse plunged and stumbled, and the baron, hanging on to my foot with a fierce grip, was wrenched from his seat. His horse, however, was up again immediately, and I was released, and then I caught a confused glimpse of the frightened and wounded animal galloping wildly away to the right, leaving a black track of blood behind him in the snow, his master, entangled in the reins, running with incredible swiftness by his side and endeavoring to vault back into the saddle.

"And now came to pass a terrible thing which, in his savage plans, my host had doubtless never anticipated.

"One of the hounds that had during this short check recovered lost ground, coming across this hot trail of blood, turned away from his course, and with a joyous yell darted after the running man. In another instant the remainder of the pack was upon the new scent.

"As soon as I could stop my horse, I tried to turn him in the direction the new chase had taken, but just then, through the night air, over the receding sound of the horse's scamper and the sobbing of the pack in full cry, there came a long scream, and after that a sickening silence. And I knew that somewhere yonder, under the beautiful moonlight, the Baron Kossowski was being devoured by his starving dogs.

"I looked round, with the sweat on my face, vaguely, for some human being to share the horror of the moment, and I saw, gliding away, far away in the white distance, the black silhouette of the sledge."

"Well?" said we, in divers tones of impatience, curiosity, or horror, according to our divers temperaments, as the speaker uncrossed his legs and gazed at us in mild triumph, with all the air of having said his say, and satisfactorily proved his point.

"Well," repeated he, "what more do you want to know? It will interest you but slightly, I am sure, to hear how I found my way back to the Hof; or how I told as much as I deemed prudent of the evening's grewsome work to the baron's servants, who, by the way, to my amazement, displayed the profoundest and most unmistakable sorrow at the tidings, and sallied forth (at their head the Cossack who had seen us depart) to seek for his remains. Excuse the unpleasantness of the remark: I fear the dogs must have left very little of him, he had dieted them so carefully. However, since it was to have been a case of 'chop, crunch, and gobble,' as the baron had it, I preferred that that particular fate should have overtaken him rather than me—or, for that matter, either of those two country people of ours in the sledge.

"Nor am I going to inflict upon you," continued Marshfield, after draining his glass, "a full account of my impressions when I found myself once more in that immense, deserted, and stricken house, so luxuriously prepared for the mistress who had fled from it; how I philosophized over all this, according to my wont; the conjectures I made as to the first acts of the drama; the untold sufferings my countrywoman must have endured from the moment her husband first grew jealous till she determined on this desperate step; as to how and when she had met her lover, how they communicated, and how the baron had discovered the intended flitting in time to concoct his characteristic revenge.

"One thing you may be sure of, I had no mind to remain at Yany an hour longer than necessary. I even contrived to get well clear of the neighborhood before the lady's absence was discovered. Luckily for me—or I might have been taxed with connivance, though indeed the simple household did not seem to know what suspicion was, and accepted my account with childlike credence—very typical, and very convenient to me at the same time."

"But how do you know," said one of us, "that the man was her lover? He might have been her brother or some other relative."

"That," said Marshfield, with his little flat laugh, "I happen to have ascertained—and, curiously enough, only a few weeks ago. It was at the play, between the acts, from my comfortable seat (the first row in the pit). I was looking leisurely round the house when I caught sight of a woman, in a box close by, whose head was turned from me, and who presented the somewhat unusual spectacle of a young neck and shoulders of the most exquisite contour—and perfectly gray hair; and not dull gray, but rather of a pleasing tint like frosted silver. This aroused my curiosity. I brought my glasses to a focus on her and waited patiently till she turned round. Then I recognized the Baroness Kassowski, and I no longer wondered at the young hair being white.

"Yet she looked placid and happy; strangely so, it seemed to me, under the sudden reviving in my memory of such scenes as I have now described. But presently I understood further: beside her, in close attendance, was the man of the sledge, a handsome fellow with much of a military air about him.

"During the course of the evening, as I watched, I saw a friend of mine come into the box, and at the end I slipped out into the passage to catch him as he came out.

"'Who is the woman with the white hair?' I asked. Then, in the fragmentary style approved of by ultra-fashionable young men—this earnest-languid mode of speech presents curious similarities in all languages—he told me: 'Most charming couple in London—awfully pretty, wasn't she?—he had been in the Guards—attaché at Vienna once—they adored each other. White hair, devilish queer, wasn't it? Suited her, somehow. And then she had been married to a Russian, or something, somewhere in the wilds, and their names were—' But do you know," said Marshfield, interrupting himself, "I think I had better let you find that out for yourselves, if you care."

The Fowl in the Pot

An Episode Adapted from the Memoirs of Maximilian de Bethune, Duke of Sully

What I am going to relate may seem to some merely to be curious and on a party with the diverting story of M. Boisrosé, which I have set down in an earlier part of my memoirs. But among the calumnies of those who have never ceased to attack me since the death of the late king, the statement that I kept from his majesty things which should have reached his ears has always had a prominent place, though a thousand times refuted by my friends, and those who from an intimate acquaintance with events could judge how faithfully I labored to deserve the confidence with which my master honored me. Therefore, I take it in hand to show by an example, trifling in itself, the full knowledge of affairs which the king had, and to prove that in many matters, which were never permitted to become known to the idlers of the court, he took a personal share, worthy as much of Haroun as of Alexander.

It was my custom, before I entered upon those negotiations with the Prince of Condé which terminated in the recovery of the estate of Villebon, where I now principally reside, to spend a part of the autumn and winter at Rosny. On these occasions I was in the habit of leaving Paris with a considerable train of Swiss, pages, valets, and grooms, together with the maids of honor and waiting women of the duchess. We halted to take dinner at Poissy, and generally contrived to reach Rosny toward nightfall, so as to sup by the light of flambeaux in a manner enjoyable enough, though devoid of that state which I have ever maintained, and enjoined upon my children, as at once the privilege and burden of rank.

At the time of which I am speaking I had for my favorite charger the sorrel horse which the Duke of Mercoeur presented to me with a view to my good offices at the time of the king's entry into Paris; and which I honestly transferred to his majesty in accordance with a principle laid down in another place. The king insisted on returning it to me, and for several years I rode it on these annual visits to Rosny. What was more remarkable was that on each of these occasions it cast a shoe about the middle of the afternoon, and always when we were within a short league of the village of Aubergenville. Though I never had with me less than half a score of led horses, I had such an affection for the sorrel that I preferred to wait until it was shod, rather than accommodate myself to a nag of less easy paces; and would allow my household to precede me, staying behind myself with at most a guard or two, my valet, and a page.

The forge at Aubergenville was kept by a smith of some skill, a cheerful fellow, whom I always remembered to reward, considering my own position rather than his services, with a gold livre. His joy at receiving what was to him the income of a year was great, and never failed to reimburse me; in addition to which I took some pleasure in unbending, and learning from this simple peasant and loyal man, what the taxpayers were saying of me and my reforms—a duty I always felt I owed to the king my master.

As a man of breeding it would ill become me to set down the homely truths I thus learned. The conversations of the vulgar are little suited to a nobleman's memoirs; but in this I distinguish between the Duke of Sully and the king's minister, and it is in the latter capacity that I relate what passed on these diverting occasions. "Ho, Simon," I would say, encouraging the poor man as he came bowing and trembling before me, "how goes it, my friend?"

"Badly," he would answer, "very badly until your lordship came this way."

"And how is that, little man?"

"Oh, it is the roads," he always replied, shaking his bald head as he began to set about his business. "The roads since your lordship became surveyor-general are so good that not one horse in a hundred casts a shoe; and then there are so few highwaymen now that not one robber's plates do I replace in a twelvemonth. There is where it is."

At this I was highly delighted.

"Still, since I began to pass this way times have not been so bad with you, Simon," I would answer.

Thereto he had one invariable reply.

"No; thanks to Ste. Geneviève and your lordship, whom we call in this village the poor man's friend, I have a fowl in the pot."

This phrase so pleased me that I repeated it to the king. It tickled his fancy also, and for some years it was a very common remark of that good and great ruler, that he hoped to live to see every peasant with a fowl in his pot.

"But why," I remember I once asked this honest fellow—it was on the last occasion of the sorrel falling lame there—"do you thank Ste. Geneviève?"

"She is my patron saint," he answered.

"Then you are a Parisian?"

"Your lordship is always right."

"But does her saintship do you any good?" I asked curiously.

"Certainly, by your lordship's leave. My wife prays to her and she loosens the nails in the sorrel's shoes."

"In fact she pays off an old grudge," I answered, "for there was a time when Paris liked me little; but hark ye, master smith, I am not sure that this is not an act of treason to conspire with Madame Geneviève against the comfort of the king's minister. What think you, you rascal; can you pass the justice elm without a shiver?"

This threw the simple fellow into a great fear, which the sight of the livre of gold speedily converted into joy as stupendous. Leaving him still staring at his fortune I rode away; but when we had gone some little distance, the aspect of his face, when I charged him with treason, or my own unassisted discrimination suggested a clew to the phenomenon.

"La Trape," I said to my valet—the same who was with me at Cahors—"what is the name of the innkeeper at Poissy, at whose house we are accustomed to dine?"

"Andrew, may it please your lordship."

"Andrew! I thought so!" I exclaimed, smiting my thigh. "Simon and Andrew his brother! Answer, knave, and, if you have permitted me to be robbed these many times, tremble for your ears. Is he not brother to the smith at Aubergenville who has just shod my horse?"

La Trape professed to be ignorant on this point, but a groom who had stayed behind with me, having sought my permission to speak, said it was so, adding that Master Andrew had risen in the world through large dealings in hay, which he was wont to take daily into Paris and sell, and that he did not now acknowledge or see anything of his brother the smith, though it was believed that he retained a sneaking liking for him.

On receiving this confirmation of my suspicions, my vanity as well as my sense of justice led me to act with the promptitude which I have exhibited in greater emergencies. I rated La Trape for his carelessness of my interests in permitting this deception to be practiced on me; and the main body of my attendants being now in sight, I ordered him to take two Swiss and arrest both brothers without delay. It wanted yet three hours of sunset, and I judged that, by hard riding, they might reach Rosny with their prisoners before bedtime.

I spent some time while still on the road in considering what punishment I should inflict on the culprits; and finally laid aside the purpose I had at first conceived of putting them to death—an infliction they had richly deserved—in favor of a plan which I thought might offer me some amusement. For the execution of this I depended upon Maignan, my equerry, who was a man of lively imagination, being the same who had of his own motion arranged and carried out the triumphal procession, in which I was borne to Rosny after the battle of Ivry. Before I sat down to supper I gave him his directions; and as I had expected, news was brought to me while I was at table that the prisoners had arrived.

Thereupon I informed the duchess and the company generally, for, as was usual, a number of my country neighbors had come to compliment me on my return, that there was some sport of a rare kind on foot; and we adjourned, Maignan, followed by four pages bearing lights, leading the way to that end of the terrace which abuts on the linden avenue. Here, a score of grooms holding torches aloft had been arranged in a circle so that the impromptu theater thus formed, which Maignan had ordered with much taste, was as light as in the day. On a sloping bank at one end seats had been placed for those who had supped at my table, while the rest of the company found such places of vantage as they could; their number, indeed, amounting, with my household, to two hundred persons. In the center of the open space a small forge fire had been kindled, the red glow of which added much to the strangeness of the scene; and on the anvil beside it were ranged a number of horses' and donkeys' shoes, with a full complement of the tools used by smiths. All being ready I gave the word to bring in the prisoners, and escorted by La Trape and six of my guards, they were marched into the arena. In their pale and terrified faces, and the shaking limbs which could scarce support them to their appointed stations, I read both the consciousness of guilt and the apprehension of immediate death; it was plain that they expected nothing less. I was very willing to play with their fears, and for some time looked at them in silence, while all wondered with lively curiosity what would ensue. I then addressed them gravely, telling the innkeeper that I knew well he had loosened each year a shoe of my horse, in order that his brother might profit by the job of replacing it; and went on to reprove the smith for the ingratitude which had led him to return my bounty by the conception of so knavish a trick.

Upon this they confessed their guilt, and flinging themselves upon their knees with many tears and prayers begged for mercy. This, after a decent interval, I permitted myself to grant. "Your lives, which are forfeited, shall be spared," I pronounced. "But punished you must be. I therefore ordain that Simon, the smith, at once fit, nail, and properly secure a pair of iron shoes to Andrew's heels, and that then Andrew, who by that time will have picked up something of the smith's art, do the same to Simon. So will you both learn to avoid such shoeing tricks for the future."

It may well be imagined that a judgment so whimsical, and so justly adapted to the offense, charmed all save the culprits; and in a hundred ways the pleasure of those present was evinced, to such a degree, indeed, that Maignan had some difficulty in restoring silence and gravity to the assemblage. This done, however, Master Andrew was taken in hand and his wooden shoes removed. The tools of his trade were placed before the smith, who cast glances so piteous, first at his brother's feet and then at the shoes on the anvil, as again gave rise to a prodigious amount of merriment, my pages in particular well-nigh forgetting my presence, and rolling about in a manner unpardonable at another time. However, I rebuked them sharply, and was about to order the sentence to be carried into effect, when the remembrance of the many pleasant simplicities which the smith had uttered to me, acting upon a natural disposition to mercy, which the most calumnious of my enemies have never questioned, induced me to give the prisoners a chance of escape. "Listen," I said, "Simon and Andrew. Your sentence has been pronounced, and will certainly be executed unless you can avail yourself of the condition I now offer. You shall have three minutes; if in that time either of you can make a good joke, he shall go free. If not, let a man attend to the bellows, La Trape!"

This added a fresh satisfaction to my neighbors, who were well assured now that I had not promised them a novel entertainment without good grounds; for the grimaces of the two knaves thus bidden to jest if they would save their skins, were so diverting they would have made a nun laugh. They looked at me with their eyes as wide as plates, and for the whole of the time of grace never a word could they utter save howls for mercy. "Simon," I said gravely, when the time was up, "have you a joke? No. Andrew, my friend, have you a joke? No. Then—"

I was going on to order the sentence to be carried out, when the innkeeper flung himself again upon his knees, and cried out loudly—as much to my astonishment as to the regret of the bystanders, who were bent on seeing so strange a shoeing feat—"One word, my lord; I can give you no joke, but I can do a service, an eminent service to the king. I can disclose a conspiracy!"

I was somewhat taken aback by this sudden and public announcement. But I had been too long in the king's employment not to have remarked how strangely things are brought to light. On hearing the man's words therefore—which were followed by a stricken silence—I looked sharply at the faces of such of those present as it was possible to suspect, but failed to observe any sign of confusion or dismay, or anything more particular than so abrupt a statement was calculated to produce. Doubting much whether the man was not playing with me, I addressed him sternly, warning him to beware, lest in his anxiety to save his heels by falsely accusing others, he should lose his head. For that if his conspiracy should prove to be an invention of his own, I should certainly consider it my duty to hang him forthwith.

He heard me out, but nevertheless persisted in his story, adding desperately, "It is a plot, my lord, to assassinate you and the king on the same day."

This statement struck me a blow; for I had good reason to know that at that time the king had alienated many by his infatuation for Madame de Verneuil; while I had always to reckon firstly with all who hated him, and secondly with all whom my pursuit of his interests injured, either in reality or appearance. I therefore immediately directed that the prisoners should be led in close custody to the chamber adjoining my private closet, and taking the precaution to call my guards about me, since I knew not what attempt despair might not breed, I withdrew myself, making such apologies to the company as the nature of the case permitted.

I ordered Simon the smith to be first brought to me, and in the presence of Maignan only, I severely examined him as to his knowledge of any conspiracy. He denied, however, that he had ever heard of the matters referred to by his brother, and persisted so firmly in the denial that I was inclined to believe him. In the end he was taken out and Andrew was brought in. The innkeeper's demeanor was such as I have often observed in intriguers brought suddenly to book. He averred the existence of the conspiracy, and that its objects were those which he had stated. He also offered to give up his associates, but conditioned that he should do this in his own way; undertaking to conduct me and one other person—but no more, lest the alarm should be given—to a place in Paris on the following night, where we could hear the plotters state their plans and designs. In this way only, he urged, could proof positive be obtained.

I was much startled by this proposal, and inclined to think it a trap; but further consideration dispelled my fears. The innkeeper had held no parley with anyone save his guards and myself since his arrest, and could neither have warned his accomplices, nor acquainted them with any design the execution of which should depend on his confession to me. I therefore accepted his terms—with a private reservation that I should have help at hand—and before daybreak next morning left Rosny, which I had only seen by torchlight, with my prisoner and a select body of Swiss. We entered Paris in the afternoon in three parties, with as little parade as possible, and went straight to the Arsenal, whence, as soon as evening fell, I hurried with only two armed attendants to the Louvre.

A return so sudden and unexpected was as great a surprise to the court as to the king, and I was not slow to mark with an inward smile the discomposure which appeared very clearly on the faces of several, as the crowd in the chamber fell back for me to approach my master. I was careful, however, to remember that this might arise from other causes than guilt. The king received me with his wonted affection; and divining at once that I must have something important to communicate, withdrew with me to the farther end of the chamber, where we were out of earshot of the court. I there related the story to his majesty, keeping back nothing.

He shook his head, saying merely: "The fish to escape the frying pan, grand master, will jump into the fire. And human nature, save in the case of you and me, who can trust one another, is very fishy."

I was touched by this gracious compliment, but not convinced. "You have not seen the man, sire," I said, "and I have had that advantage."

"And believe him?"

"In part," I answered with caution. "So far at least as to be assured that he thinks to save his skin, which he will only do if he be telling the truth. May I beg you, sire," I added hastily, seeing the direction of his glance, "not to look so fixedly at the Duke of Epernon? He grows uneasy."

"Conscience makes—you know the rest."

"Nay, sire, with submission," I replied, "I will answer for him; if he be not driven by fear to do something reckless."

"Good! I take your warranty, Duke of Sully," the king said, with the easy grace which came so natural to him. "But now in this matter what would you have me do?"

"Double your guards, sire, for to-night—that is all. I will answer for the Bastile and the Arsenal; and holding these we hold Paris."

But thereupon I found that the king had come to a decision, which I felt it to be my duty to combat with all my influence. He had conceived the idea of being the one to accompany me to the rendezvous. "I am tired of the dice," he complained, "and sick of tennis, at which I know everybody's strength. Madame de Verneuil is at Fontainebleau, the queen is unwell. Ah, Sully, I would the old days were back when we had Nerac for our Paris, and knew the saddle better than the armchair!"

"A king must think of his people," I reminded him.

"The fowl in the pot? To be sure. So I will—to-morrow," he replied. And in the end he would be obeyed. I took my leave of him as if for the night, and retired, leaving him at play with the Duke of Epernon. But an hour later, toward eight o'clock, his majesty, who had made an excuse to withdraw to his closet, met me outside the eastern gate of the Louvre.

He was masked, and attended only by Coquet, his master of the household. I too wore a mask and was esquired by Maignan, under whose orders were four Swiss—whom I had chosen because they were unable to speak French—guarding the prisoner Andrew. I bade Maignan follow the innkeeper's directions, and we proceeded in two parties through the streets on the left bank of the river, past the Châtelet and Bastile, until we reached an obscure street near the water, so narrow that the decrepit wooden houses shut out well-nigh all view of the sky. Here the prisoner halted and called upon me to fulfill the terms of my agreement. I bade Maignan therefore to keep with the Swiss at a distance of fifty paces, but to come up should I whistle or otherwise give the alarm; and myself with the king and Andrew proceeded onward in the deep shadow of the houses. I kept my hand on my pistol, which I had previously shown to the prisoner, intimating that on the first sign of treachery I should blow out his brains. However, despite precaution, I felt uncomfortable to the last degree. I blamed myself severely for allowing the king to expose himself and the country to this unnecessary danger; while the meanness of the locality, the fetid air, the darkness of the night, which was wet and tempestuous, and the uncertainty of the event lowered my spirits, and made every splash in the kennel and stumble on the reeking, slippery pavements—matters over which the king grew merry—seem no light troubles to me.

Arriving at a house, which, if we might judge in the darkness, seemed to be of rather greater pretensions than its fellows, our guide stopped, and whispered to us to mount some steps to a raised wooden gallery, which intervened between the lane and the doorway. On this, besides the door, a couple of unglazed windows looked out. The shutter of one was ajar, and showed us a large, bare room, lighted by a couple of rushlights. Directing us to place ourselves close to this shutter, the innkeeper knocked at the door in a peculiar fashion, and almost immediately entered, going at once into the lighted room. Peering cautiously through the window we were surprised to find that the only person within, save the newcomer, was a young woman, who, crouching over a smoldering fire, was crooning a lullaby while she attended to a large black pot.

"Good evening, mistress!" said the innkeeper, advancing to the fire with a fair show of nonchalance.

"Good evening, Master Andrew," the girl replied, looking up and nodding, but showing no sign of surprise at his appearance. "Martin is away, but he may return at any moment."

"Is he still of the same mind?"

"Quite."

"And what of Sully? Is he to die then?" he asked.

"They have decided he must," the girl answered gloomily. It may be believed that I listened with all my ears, while the king by a nudge in my side seemed to rally me on the destiny so coolly arranged for me. "Martin says it is no good killing the other unless he goes too—they have been so long together. But it vexes me sadly, Master Andrew," she added with a sudden break in her voice. "Sadly it vexes me. I could not sleep last night for thinking of it, and the risk Martin runs. And I shall sleep less when it is done."

"Pooh-pooh!" said that rascally innkeeper. "Think less about it. Things will grow worse and worse if they are let live. The King has done harm enough already. And he grows old besides."

"That is true!" said the girl. "And no doubt the sooner he is put out of the way the better. He is changed sadly. I do not say a word for him. Let him die. It is killing Sully that troubles me—that and the risk Martin runs."

At this I took the liberty of gently touching the king. He answered by an amused grimace; then by a motion of his hand he enjoined silence. We stooped still farther forward so as better to command the room. The girl was rocking herself to and fro in evident distress of mind. "If we killed the King," she continued, "Martin declares we should be no better off, as long as Sully lives. Both or neither, he says. But I do not know. I cannot bear to think of it. It was a sad day when we brought Epernon here, Master Andrew; and one I fear we shall rue as long as we live."

It was now the king's turn to be moved. He grasped my wrist so forcibly that I restrained a cry with difficulty. "Epernon!" he whispered harshly in my ear. "They are Epernon's tools! Where is your guaranty now, Rosny?"

I confess that I trembled. I knew well that the king, particular in small courtesies, never forgot to call his servants by their correct titles, save in two cases; when he indicated by the seeming error, as once in Marshal Biron's affair, his intention to promote or degrade them; or when he was moved to the depths of his nature and fell into an old habit. I did not dare to reply, but listened greedily for more information.

"When is it to be done?" asked the innkeeper, sinking his voice and glancing round, as if he would call especial attention to this.

"That depends upon Master la Rivière," the girl answered. "To-morrow night, I understand, if Master la Rivière can have the stuff ready."

I met the king's eyes. They shone fiercely in the faint light, which issuing from the window fell on him. Of all things he hated treachery most, and La Rivière was his first body physician, and at this very time, as I well knew, was treating him for a slight derangement which the king had brought upon himself by his imprudence. This doctor had formerly been in the employment of the Bouillon family, who had surrendered his services to the king. Neither I nor his majesty had trusted the Duke of Bouillon for the last year past, so that we were not surprised by this hint that he was privy to the design.

Despite our anxiety not to miss a word, an approaching step warned us at this moment to draw back. More than once before we had done so to escape the notice of a wayfarer passing up and down. But this time I had a difficulty in inducing the king to adopt the precaution. Yet it was well that I succeeded, for the person who came stumbling along toward us did not pass, but, mounting the steps, walked by within touch of us and entered the house.

"The plot thickens," muttered the king. "Who is this?"

At the moment he asked I was racking my brain to remember. I have a good eye and a fair recollection for faces, and this was one I had seen several times. The features were so familiar that I suspected the man of being a courtier in disguise, and I ran over the names of several persons whom I knew to be Bouillon's secret agents. But he was none of these, and obeying the king's gesture, I bent myself again to the task of listening.

The girl looked up on the man's entrance, but did not rise. "You are late, Martin," she said.

"A little," the newcomer answered. "How do you do, Master Andrew? What cheer? What, still vexing, mistress?" he added contemptuously to the girl. "You have too soft a heart for this business!"

She sighed, but made no answer.

"You have made up your mind to it, I hear?" said the innkeeper.

"That is it. Needs must when the devil drives!" replied the man jauntily. He had a downcast, reckless, luckless air, yet in his face I thought I still saw traces of a better spirit.

"The devil in this case was Epernon," quoth Andrew.

"Aye, curse him! I would I had cut his dainty throat before he crossed my threshold," cried the desperado. "But there, it is too late to say that now. What has to be done, has to be done."

"How are you going about it? Poison, the mistress says."

"Yes; but if I had my way," the man growled fiercely, "I would out one of these nights and cut the dogs' throats in the kennel!"

"You could never escape, Martin!" the girl cried, rising in excitement. "It would be hopeless. It would merely be throwing away your own life."

"Well, it is not to be done that way, so there is an end of it," quoth the man wearily. "Give me my supper. The devil take the king and Sully too! He will soon have them."

On this Master Andrew rose, and I took his movement toward the door for a signal for us to retire. He came out at once, shutting the door behind him as he bade the pair within a loud good night. He found us standing in the street waiting for him and forthwith fell on his knees in the mud and looked up at me, the perspiration standing thick on his white face. "My lord," he cried hoarsely, "I have earned my pardon!"

"If you go on," I said encouragingly, "as you have begun, have no fear." Without more ado I whistled up the Swiss and bade Maignan go with them and arrest the man and woman with as little disturbance as possible. While this was being done we waited without, keeping a sharp eye upon the informer, whose terror, I noted with suspicion, seemed to be in no degree diminished. He did not, however, try to escape, and Maignan presently came to tell us that he had executed the arrest without difficulty or resistance.

The importance of arriving at the truth before Epernon and the greater conspirators should take the alarm was so vividly present to the minds of the king and myself, that we did not hesitate to examine the prisoners in their house, rather than hazard the delay and observation which their removal to a more fit place must occasion. Accordingly, taking the precaution to post Coquet in the street outside, and to plant a burly Swiss in the doorway, the king and I entered. I removed my mask as I did so, being aware of the necessity of gaining the prisoners' confidence, but I begged the king to retain his. As I had expected, the man immediately recognized me and fell on his knees, a nearer view confirming the notion I had previously entertained that his features were familiar to me, though I could not remember his name. I thought this a good starting-point for my examination, and bidding Maignan withdraw, I assumed an air of mildness and asked the fellow his name.

"Martin, only, please your lordship," he answered; adding, "once I sold you two dogs, sir, for the chase, and to your lady a lapdog called Ninette no larger than her hand."

I remembered the knave, then, as a fashionable dog dealer, who had been much about the court in the reign of Henry the Third and later; and I saw at once how convenient a tool he might be made, since he could be seen in converse with people of all ranks without arousing suspicion. The man's face as he spoke expressed so much fear and surprise that I determined to try what I had often found successful in the case of greater criminals, to squeeze him for a confession while still excited by his arrest, and before he should have had time to consider what his chances of support at the hands of his confederates might be. I charged him therefore solemnly to tell the whole truth as he hoped for the king's mercy. He heard me, gazing at me piteously; but his only answer, to my surprise, was that he had nothing to confess.

"Come, come," I replied sternly, "this will avail you nothing; if you do not speak quickly, rogue, and to the point, we shall find means to compel you. Who counseled you to attempt his majesty's life?"

On this he stared so stupidly at me, and exclaimed with so real an appearance of horror: "How? I attempt the king's life? God forbid!" that I doubted that we had before us a more dangerous rascal than I had thought, and I hastened to bring him to the point.

"What, then," I cried, frowning, "of the stuff Master la Rivière is to give you to take the king's life to-morrow night? Oh, we know something, I assure you; bethink you quickly, and find your tongue if you would have an easy death."

I expected to see his self-control break down at this proof of our knowledge of his design, but he only stared at me with the same look of bewilderment. I was about to bid them bring in the informer that I might see the two front to front, when the female prisoner, who had hitherto stood beside her companion in such distress and terror as might be expected in a woman of that class, suddenly stopped her tears and lamentations. It occurred to me that she might make a better witness. I turned to her, but when I would have questioned her she broke into a wild scream of hysterical laughter.

From that I remember that I learned nothing, though it greatly annoyed me. But there was one present who did—the king. He laid his hand on my shoulder, gripping it with a force that I read as a command to be silent.

"Where," he said to the man, "do you keep the King and Sully and Epernon, my friend?"

"The King and Sully—with the lordship's leave," said the man quickly, with a frightened glance at me—"are in the kennels at the back of the house, but it is not safe to go near them. The King is raving mad, and—and the other dog is sickening. Epernon we had to kill a month back. He brought the disease here, and I have had such losses through him as have nearly ruined me, please your lordship."

"Get up—get up, man!" cried the king, and tearing off his mask he stamped up and down the room, so torn by paroxysms of laughter that he choked himself when again and again he attempted to speak.

I too now saw the mistake, but I could not at first see it in the same light. Commanding myself as well as I could, I ordered one of the Swiss to fetch in the innkeeper, but to admit no one else.

The knave fell on his knees as soon as he saw me, his cheeks shaking like a jelly.

"Mercy, mercy!" was all he could say.

"You have dared to play with me?" I whispered.

"You bade me joke," he sobbed, "you bade me."

I was about to say that it would be his last joke in this world—for my anger was fully aroused—when the king intervened.

"Nay," he said, laying his hand softly on my shoulder. "It has been the most glorious jest. I would not have missed it for a kingdom. I command you, Sully, to forgive him."

Thereupon his majesty strictly charged the three that they should not on peril of their lives mention the circumstances to anyone. Nor to the best of my belief did they do so, being so shrewdly scared when they recognized the king that I verily think they never afterwards so much as spoke of the affair to one another. My master further gave me on his own part his most gracious promise that he would not disclose the matter even to Madame de Verneuil or the queen, and upon these representations he induced me freely to forgive the innkeeper. So ended this conspiracy, on the diverting details of which I may seem to have dwelt longer than I should; but alas! in twenty-one years of power I investigated many, and this one only can I regard with satisfaction. The rest were so many warnings and predictions of the fate which, despite all my care and fidelity, was in store for the great and good master I served.

The Pavilion on the Links
I

I was a great solitary when I was young. I made it my pride to keep aloof and suffice for my own entertainment; and I may say that I had neither friends nor acquaintances until I met that friend who became my wife and the mother of my children. With one man only was I on private terms; this was R. Northmour, Esquire, of Graden Easter, in Scotland. We had met at college; and though there was not much liking between us, nor even much intimacy, we were so nearly of a humor that we could associate with ease to both. Misanthropes, we believed ourselves to be; but I have thought since that we were only sulky fellows. It was scarcely a companionship, but a co-existence in unsociability. Northmour's exceptional violence of temper made it no easy affair for him to keep the peace with anyone but me; and as he respected my silent ways, and let me come and go as I pleased, I could tolerate his presence without concern. I think we called each other friends.

When Northmour took his degree and I decided to leave the university without one, he invited me on a long visit to Graden Easter; and it was thus that I first became acquainted with the scene of my adventures. The mansion house of Graden stood in a bleak stretch of country some three miles from the shore of the German Ocean. It was as large as a barrack; and as it had been built of a soft stone, liable to consume in the eager air of the seaside, it was damp and draughty within and half ruinous without. It was impossible for two young men to lodge with comfort in such a dwelling. But there stood in the northern part of the estate, in a wilderness of links and blowing sand hills, and between a plantation and the sea, a small pavilion or belvedere, of modern design, which was exactly suited to our wants; and in this hermitage, speaking little, reading much, and rarely associating except at meals, Northmour and I spent four tempestuous winter months. I might have stayed longer; but one March night there sprung up between us a dispute, which rendered my departure necessary. Northmour spoke hotly, I remember, and I suppose I must have made some tart rejoinder. He leaped from his chair and grappled me; I had to fight, without exaggeration, for my life; and it was only with a great effort that I mastered him, for he was near as strong in body as myself, and seemed filled with the devil. The next morning, we met on our usual terms; but I judged it more delicate to withdraw; nor did he attempt to dissuade me.

It was nine years before I revisited the neighborhood. I traveled at that time with a tilt-cart, a tent, and a cooking stove, tramping all day beside the wagon, and at night, whenever it was possible, gypsying in a cove of the hills, or by the side of a wood. I believe I visited in this manner most of the wild and desolate regions both in England and Scotland; and, as I had neither friends nor relations, I was troubled with no correspondence, and had nothing in the nature of headquarters, unless it was the office of my solicitors, from whom I drew my income twice a year. It was a life in which I delighted; and I fully thought to have grown old upon the march, and at last died in a ditch.

It was my whole business to find desolate corners, where I could camp without the fear of interruption; and hence, being in another part of the same shire, I bethought me suddenly of the Pavilion on the Links. No thoroughfare passed within three miles of it. The nearest town, and that was but a fisher village, was at a distance of six or seven. For ten miles of length, and from a depth varying from three miles to half a mile, this belt of barren country lay along the sea. The beach, which was the natural approach, was full of quicksands. Indeed I may say there is hardly a better place of concealment in the United Kingdom. I determined to pass a week in the Sea-Wood of Graden Easter, and making a long stage, reached it about sundown on a wild September day.

The country, I have said, was mixed sand hill and links; links being a Scottish name for sand which has ceased drifting and become more or less solidly covered with turf. The pavilion stood on an even space: a little behind it, the wood began in a hedge of elders huddled together by the wind; in front, a few tumbled sand hills stood between it and the sea. An outcropping of rock had formed a bastion for the sand, so that there was here a promontory in the coast line between two shallow bays; and just beyond the tides, the rock again cropped out and formed an islet of small dimensions but strikingly designed. The quicksands were of great extent at low water, and had an infamous reputation in the country. Close in shore, between the islet and the promontory, it was said they would swallow a man in four minutes and a half; but there may have been little ground for this precision. The district was alive with rabbits, and haunted by gulls which made a continual piping about the pavilion. On summer days the outlook was bright and even gladsome; but at sundown in September, with a high wind, and a heavy surf rolling in close along the links, the place told of nothing but dead mariners and sea disaster. A ship beating to windward on the horizon, and a huge truncheon of wreck half buried in the sands at my feet, completed the innuendo of the scene.

The pavilion—it had been built by the last proprietor, Northmour's uncle, a silly and prodigal virtuoso—presented little signs of age. It was two stories in height, Italian in design, surrounded by a patch of garden in which nothing had prospered but a few coarse flowers; and looked, with its shuttered windows, not like a house that had been deserted, but like one that had never been tenanted by man. Northmour was plainly from home; whether, as usual, sulking in the cabin of his yacht, or in one of his fitful and extravagant appearances in the world of society, I had, of course, no means of guessing. The place had an air of solitude that daunted even a solitary like myself; the wind cried in the chimneys with a strange and wailing note; and it was with a sense of escape, as if I were going indoors, that I turned away and, driving my cart before me, entered the skirts of the wood.

The Sea-Wood of Graden had been planted to shelter the cultivated fields behind, and check the encroachments of the blowing sand. As you advanced into it from coastward, elders were succeeded by other hardy shrubs; but the timber was all stunted and bushy; it led a life of conflict; the trees were accustomed to swing there all night long in fierce winter tempests; and even in early spring, the leaves were already flying, and autumn was beginning, in this exposed plantation. Inland the ground rose into a little hill, which, along with the islet, served as a sailing mark for seamen. When the hill was open of the islet to the north, vessels must bear well to the eastward to clear Graden Ness and the Graden Bullers. In the lower ground, a streamlet ran among the trees, and, being dammed with dead leaves and clay of its own carrying, spread out every here and there, and lay in stagnant pools. One or two ruined cottages were dotted about the wood; and, according to Northmour, these were ecclesiastical foundations, and in their time had sheltered pious hermits.

I found a den, or small hollow, where there was a spring of pure water; and there, clearing away the brambles, I pitched the tent, and made a fire to cook my supper. My horse I picketed farther in the wood where there was a patch of sward. The banks of the den not only concealed the light of my fire, but sheltered me from the wind, which was cold as well as high.

The life I was leading made me both hardy and frugal. I never drank but water, and rarely eat anything more costly than oatmeal; and I required so little sleep, that, although I rose with the peep of day, I would often lie long awake in the dark or starry watches of the night. Thus in Graden Sea-Wood, although I fell thankfully asleep by eight in the evening I was awake again before eleven with a full possession of my faculties, and no sense of drowsiness or fatigue. I rose and sat by the fire, watching the trees and clouds tumultuously tossing and fleeing overhead, and hearkening to the wind and the rollers along the shore; till at length, growing weary of inaction, I quitted the den, and strolled toward the borders of the wood. A young moon, buried in mist, gave a faint illumination to my steps; and the light grew brighter as I walked forth into the links. At the same moment, the wind, smelling salt of the open ocean and carrying particles of sand, struck me with its full force, so that I had to bow my head.

When I raised it again to look about me, I was aware of a light in the pavilion. It was not stationary; but passed from one window to another, as though some one were reviewing the different apartments with a lamp or candle. I watched it for some seconds in great surprise. When I had arrived in the afternoon the house had been plainly deserted; now it was as plainly occupied. It was my first idea that a gang of thieves might have broken in and be now ransacking Northmour's cupboards, which were many and not ill supplied. But what should bring thieves at Graden Easter? And, again, all the shutters had been thrown open, and it would have been more in the character of such gentry to close them. I dismissed the notion, and fell back upon another. Northmour himself must have arrived, and was now airing and inspecting the pavilion.

I have said that there was no real affection between this man and me; but, had I loved him like a brother, I was then so much more in love with solitude that I should none the less have shunned his company. As it was, I turned and ran for it; and it was with genuine satisfaction that I found myself safely back beside the fire. I had escaped an acquaintance; I should have one more night in comfort. In the morning, I might either slip away before Northmour was abroad, or pay him as short a visit as I chose.

But when morning came, I thought the situation so diverting that I forgot my shyness. Northmour was at my mercy; I arranged a good practical jest, though I knew well that my neighbor was not the man to jest with in security; and, chuckling beforehand over its success, took my place among the elders at the edge of the wood, whence I could command the door of the pavilion. The shutters were all once more closed, which I remember thinking odd; and the house, with its white walls and green venetians, looked spruce and habitable in the morning light. Hour after hour passed, and still no sign of Northmour. I knew him for a sluggard in the morning; but, as it drew on toward noon, I lost my patience. To say the truth, I had promised myself to break my fast in the pavilion, and hunger began to prick me sharply. It was a pity to let the opportunity go by without some cause for mirth; but the grosser appetite prevailed, and I relinquished my jest with regret, and sallied from the wood.

The appearance of the house affected me, as I drew near, with disquietude. It seemed unchanged since last evening; and I had expected it, I scarce knew why, to wear some external signs of habitation. But no: the windows were all closely shuttered, the chimneys breathed no smoke, and the front door itself was closely padlocked. Northmour, therefore, had entered by the back; this was the natural, and indeed, the necessary conclusion; and you may judge of my surprise when, on turning the house, I found the back door similarly secured.

My mind at once reverted to the original theory of thieves; and I blamed myself sharply for my last night's inaction. I examined all the windows on the lower story, but none of them had been tampered with; I tried the padlocks, but they were both secure. It thus became a problem how the thieves, if thieves they were, had managed to enter the house. They must have got, I reasoned, upon the roof of the outhouse where Northmour used to keep his photographic battery; and from thence, either by the window of the study or that of my old bedroom, completed their burglarious entry.

I followed what I supposed was their example; and, getting on the roof, tried the shutters of each room. Both were secure; but I was not to be beaten; and, with a little force, one of them flew open, grazing, as it did so, the back of my hand. I remember, I put the wound to my mouth, and stood for perhaps half a minute licking it like a dog, and mechanically gazing behind me over the waste links and the sea; and, in that space of time, my eye made note of a large schooner yacht some miles to the northeast. Then I threw up the window and climbed in.

I went over the house, and nothing can express my mystification. There was no sign of disorder, but, on the contrary, the rooms were unusually clean and pleasant. I found fires laid, ready for lighting; three bedrooms prepared with a luxury quite foreign to Northmour's habits, and with water in the ewers and the beds turned down; a table set for three in the dining-room; and an ample supply of cold meats, game, and vegetables on the pantry shelves. There were guests expected, that was plain; but why guests, when Northmour hated society? And, above all, why was the house thus stealthily prepared at dead of night? and why were the shutters closed and the doors padlocked?

I effaced all traces of my visit, and came forth from the window feeling sobered and concerned.

The schooner yacht was still in the same place; and it flashed for a moment through my mind that this might be the "Red Earl" bringing the owner of the pavilion and his guests. But the vessel's head was set the other way.
II

I returned to the den to cook myself a meal, of which I stood in great need, as well as to care for my horse, whom I had somewhat neglected in the morning. From time to time I went down to the edge of the wood; but there was no change in the pavilion, and not a human creature was seen all day upon the links. The schooner in the offing was the one touch of life within my range of vision. She, apparently with no set object, stood off and on or lay to, hour after hour; but as the evening deepened, she drew steadily nearer. I became more convinced that she carried Northmour and his friends, and that they would probably come ashore after dark; not only because that was of a piece with the secrecy of the preparations, but because the tide would not have flowed sufficiently before eleven to cover Graden Floe and the other sea quags that fortified the shore against invaders.

All day the wind had been going down, and the sea along with it; but there was a return toward sunset of the heavy weather of the day before. The night set in pitch dark. The wind came off the sea in squalls, like the firing of a battery of cannon; now and then there was a flaw of rain, and the surf rolled heavier with the rising tide. I was down at my observatory among the elders, when a light was run up to the masthead of the schooner, and showed she was closer in than when I had last seen her by the dying daylight. I concluded that this must be a signal to Northmour's associates on shore; and, stepping forth into the links, looked around me for something in response.

A small footpath ran along the margin of the wood, and formed the most direct communication between the pavilion and the mansion house; and, as I cast my eyes to that side, I saw a spark of light, not a quarter of a mile away, and rapidly approaching. From its uneven course it appeared to be the light of a lantern carried by a person who followed the windings of the path, and was often staggered, and taken aback by the more violent squalls. I concealed myself once more among the elders, and waited eagerly for the newcomer's advance. It proved to be a woman; and, as she passed within half a rod of my ambush, I was able to recognize the features. The deaf and silent old dame, who had nursed Northmour in his childhood, was his associate in this underhand affair.

I followed her at a little distance, taking advantage of the innumerable heights and hollows, concealed by the darkness, and favored not only by the nurse's deafness, but by the uproar of the wind and surf. She entered the pavilion, and, going at once to the upper story, opened and set a light in one of the windows that looked toward the sea. Immediately afterwards the light at the schooner's masthead was run down and extinguished. Its purpose had been attained, and those on board were sure that they were expected. The old woman resumed her preparations; although the other shutters remained closed, I could see a glimmer going to and fro about the house; and a gush of sparks from one chimney after another soon told me that the fires were being kindled.

Northmour and his guests, I was now persuaded, would come ashore as soon as there was water on the floe. It was a wild night for boat service; and I felt some alarm mingle with my curiosity as I reflected on the danger of the landing. My old acquaintance, it was true, was the most eccentric of men; but the present eccentricity was both disquieting and lugubrious to consider. A variety of feelings thus led me toward the beach, where I lay flat on my face in a hollow within six feet of the track that led to the pavilion. Thence, I should have the satisfaction of recognizing the arrivals, and, if they should prove to be acquaintances, greeting them as soon as they landed.

Some time before eleven, while the tide was still dangerously low, a boat's lantern appeared close in shore; and, my attention being thus awakened, I could perceive another still far to seaward, violently tossed, and sometimes hidden by the billows. The weather, which was getting dirtier as the night went on, and the perilous situation of the yacht upon a lee shore, had probably driven them to attempt a landing at the earliest possible moment.

A little afterwards, four yachtsmen carrying a very heavy chest, and guided by a fifth with a lantern, passed close in front of me as I lay, and were admitted to the pavilion by the nurse. They returned to the beach, and passed me a third time with another chest, larger but apparently not so heavy as the first. A third time they made the transit; and on this occasion one of the yachtsmen carried a leather portmanteau, and the others a lady's trunk and carriage bag. My curiosity was sharply excited. If a woman were among the guests of Northmour, it would show a change in his habits, and an apostasy from his pet theories of life, well calculated to fill me with surprise. When he and I dwelt there together, the pavilion had been a temple of misogyny. And now, one of the detested sex was to be installed under its roof. I remembered one or two particulars, a few notes of daintiness and almost of coquetry which had struck me the day before as I surveyed the preparations in the house; their purpose was now clear, and I thought myself dull not to have perceived it from the first.

While I was thus reflecting, a second lantern drew near me from the beach. It was carried by a yachtsman whom I had not yet seen, and who was conducting two other persons to the pavilion. These two persons were unquestionably the guests for whom the house was made ready; and, straining eye and ear, I set myself to watch them as they passed. One was an unusually tall man, in a traveling hat slouched over his eyes, and a highland cape closely buttoned and turned up so as to conceal his face. You could make out no more of him than that he was, as I have said, unusually tall, and walked feebly with a heavy stoop. By his side, and either clinging to him or giving him support—I could not make out which—was a young, tall, and slender figure of a woman. She was extremely pale; but in the light of the lantern her face was so marred by strong and changing shadows, that she might equally well have been as ugly as sin or as beautiful as I afterwards found her to be.

When they were just abreast of me, the girl made some remark which was drowned by the noise of the wind.

"Hush!" said her companion; and there was something in the tone with which the word was uttered that thrilled and rather shook my spirits. It seemed to breathe from a bosom laboring under the deadliest terror; I have never heard another syllable so expressive; and I still hear it again when I am feverish at night, and my mind runs upon old times. The man turned toward the girl as he spoke; I had a glimpse of much red beard and a nose which seemed to have been broken in youth; and his light eyes seemed shining in his face with some strong and unpleasant emotion.

But these two passed on and were admitted in their turn to the pavilion.

One by one, or in groups, the seamen returned to the beach. The wind brought me the sound of a rough voice crying, "Shove off!" Then, after a pause, another lantern drew near. It was Northmour alone.

My wife and I, a man and a woman, have often agreed to wonder how a person could be, at the same time, so handsome and so repulsive as Northmour. He had the appearance of a finished gentleman; his face bore every mark of intelligence and courage; but you had only to look at him, even in his most amiable moment, to see that he had the temper of a slaver captain. I never knew a character that was both explosive and revengeful to the same degree; he combined the vivacity of the south with the sustained and deadly hatreds of the north; and both traits were plainly written on his face, which was a sort of danger signal. In person, he was tall, strong, and active; his hair and complexion very dark; his features handsomely designed, but spoiled by a menacing expression.

At that moment he was somewhat paler than by nature; he wore a heavy frown; and his lips worked, and he looked sharply round him as he walked, like a man besieged with apprehensions. And yet I thought he had a look of triumph underlying all, as though he had already done much, and was near the end of an achievement.

Partly from a scruple of delicacy—which I dare say came too late—partly from the pleasure of startling an acquaintance, I desired to make my presence known to him without delay.

I got suddenly to my feet, and stepped forward.

"Northmour!" said I.

I have never had so shocking a surprise in all my days. He leaped on me without a word; something shone in his hand; and he struck for my heart with a dagger. At the same moment I knocked him head over heels. Whether it was my quickness, or his own uncertainty, I know not; but the blade only grazed my shoulder, while the hilt and his fist struck me violently on the mouth.

I fled, but not far. I had often and often observed the capabilities of the sand hills for protracted ambush or stealthy advances and retreats; and, not ten yards from the scene of the scuffle, plumped down again upon the grass. The lantern had fallen and gone out. But what was my astonishment to see Northmour slip at a bound into the pavilion, and hear him bar the door behind him with a clang of iron!

He had not pursued me. He had run away. Northmour, whom I knew for the most implacable and daring of men, had run away! I could scarce believe my reason; and yet in this strange business, where all was incredible, there was nothing to make a work about in an incredibility more or less. For why was the pavilion secretly prepared? Why had Northmour landed with his guests at dead of night, in half a gale of wind, and with the floe scarce covered? Why had he sought to kill me? Had he not recognized my voice? I wondered. And, above all, how had he come to have a dagger ready in his hand? A dagger, or even a sharp knife, seemed out of keeping with the age in which we lived; and a gentleman landing from his yacht on the shore of his own estate, even although it was at night and with some mysterious circumstances, does not usually, as a matter of fact, walk thus prepared for deadly onslaught. The more I reflected, the further I felt at sea. I recapitulated the elements of mystery, counting them on my fingers: the pavilion secretly prepared for guests; the guests landed at the risk of their lives and to the imminent peril of the yacht; the guests, or at least one of them, in undisguised and seemingly causeless terror; Northmour with a naked weapon; Northmour stabbing his most intimate acquaintance at a word; last, and not least strange, Northmour fleeing from the man whom he had sought to murder, and barricading himself, like a hunted creature, behind the door of the pavilion. Here were at least six separate causes for extreme surprise; each part and parcel with the others, and forming all together one consistent story. I felt almost ashamed to believe my own senses.

As I thus stood, transfixed with wonder, I began to grow painfully conscious of the injuries I had received in the scuffle; skulked round among the sand hills; and, by a devious path, regained the shelter of the wood. On the way, the old nurse passed again within several yards of me, still carrying her lantern, on the return journey to the mansion house of Graden. This made a seventh suspicious feature in the case. Northmour and his guests, it appeared, were to cook and do the cleaning for themselves, while the old woman continued to inhabit the big empty barrack among the policies. There must surely be great cause for secrecy, when so many inconveniences were confronted to preserve it.

So thinking, I made my way to the den. For greater security, I trod out the embers of the fire, and lighted my lantern to examine the wound upon my shoulder. It was a trifling hurt, although it bled somewhat freely, and I dressed it as well as I could (for its position made it difficult to reach) with some rag and cold water from the spring. While I was thus busied, I mentally declared war against Northmour and his mystery. I am not an angry man by nature, and I believe there was more curiosity than resentment in my heart. But war I certainly declared; and, by way of preparation, I got out my revolver, and, having drawn the charges, cleaned and reloaded it with scrupulous care. Next I became preoccupied about my horse. It might break loose, or fall to neighing, and so betray my camp in the Sea-Wood. I determined to rid myself of its neighborhood; and long before dawn I was leading it over the links in the direction of the fisher village.
III

For two days I skulked round the pavilion, profiting by the uneven surface of the links. I became an adept in the necessary tactics. These low hillocks and shallow dells, running one into another, became a kind of cloak of darkness for my inthralling, but perhaps dishonorable, pursuit.

Yet, in spite of this advantage, I could learn but little of Northmour or his guests.

Fresh provisions were brought under cover of darkness by the old woman from the mansion house. Northmour, and the young lady, sometimes together, but more often singly, would walk for an hour or two at a time on the beach beside the quicksand. I could not but conclude that this promenade was chosen with an eye to secrecy; for the spot was open only to seaward. But it suited me not less excellently; the highest and most accidented of the sand hills immediately adjoined; and from these, lying flat in a hollow, I could overlook Northmour or the young lady as they walked.

The tall man seemed to have disappeared. Not only did he never cross the threshold, but he never so much as showed face at a window; or, at least, not so far as I could see; for I dared not creep forward beyond a certain distance in the day, since the upper floors commanded the bottoms of the links; and at night, when I could venture further, the lower windows were barricaded as if to stand a siege. Sometimes I thought the tall man must be confined to bed, for I remembered the feebleness of his gait; and sometimes I thought he must have gone clear away, and that Northmour and the young lady remained alone together in the pavilion. The idea, even then, displeased me.

Whether or not this pair were man and wife, I had seen abundant reason to doubt the friendliness of their relation. Although I could hear nothing of what they said, and rarely so much as glean a decided expression on the face of either, there was a distance, almost a stiffness, in their bearing which showed them to be either unfamiliar or at enmity. The girl walked faster when she was with Northmour than when she was alone; and I conceived that any inclination between a man and a woman would rather delay than accelerate the step. Moreover, she kept a good yard free of him, and trailed her umbrella, as if it were a barrier, on the side between them. Northmour kept sidling closer; and, as the girl retired from his advance, their course lay at a sort of diagonal across the beach, and would have landed them in the surf had it been long enough continued. But, when this was imminent, the girl would unostentatiously change sides and put Northmour between her and the sea. I watched these maneuvers, for my part, with high enjoyment and approval, and chuckled to myself at every move.

On the morning of the third day, she walked alone for some time, and I perceived, to my great concern, that she was more than once in tears. You will see that my heart was already interested more than I supposed. She had a firm yet airy motion of the body, and carried her head with unimaginable grace; every step was a thing to look at, and she seemed in my eyes to breathe sweetness and distinction.

The day was so agreeable, being calm and sunshiny, with a tranquil sea, and yet with a healthful piquancy and vigor in the air, that, contrary to custom, she was tempted forth a second time to walk. On this occasion she was accompanied by Northmour, and they had been but a short while on the beach, when I saw him take forcible possession of her hand. She struggled, and uttered a cry that was almost a scream. I sprung to my feet, unmindful of my strange position; but, ere I had taken a step, I saw Northmour bareheaded and bowing very low, as if to apologize; and dropped again at once into my ambush. A few words were interchanged; and then, with another bow, he left the beach to return to the pavilion. He passed not far from me, and I could see him, flushed and lowering, and cutting savagely with his cane among the grass. It was not without satisfaction that I recognized my own handiwork in a great cut under his right eye, and a considerable discoloration round the socket.

For some time the girl remained where he had left her, looking out past the islet and over the bright sea. Then with a start, as one who throws off preoccupation and puts energy again upon its mettle, she broke into a rapid and decisive walk. She also was much incensed by what had passed. She had forgotten where she was. And I beheld her walk straight into the borders of the quicksand where it is most abrupt and dangerous. Two or three steps farther and her life would have been in serious jeopardy, when I slid down the face of the sand hill, which is there precipitous, and, running halfway forward, called to her to stop.

She did so, and turned round. There was not a tremor of fear in her behavior, and she marched directly up to me like a queen. I was barefoot, and clad like a common sailor, save for an Egyptian scarf round my waist; and she probably took me at first for some one from the fisher village, straying after bait. As for her, when I thus saw her face to face, her eyes set steadily and imperiously upon mine, I was filled with admiration and astonishment, and thought her even more beautiful than I had looked to find her. Nor could I think enough of one who, acting with so much boldness, yet preserved a maidenly air that was both quaint and engaging; for my wife kept an old-fashioned precision of manner through all her admirable life—an excellent thing in woman, since it sets another value on her sweet familiarities.

"What does this mean?" she asked.

"You were walking," I told her, "directly into Graden Floe."

"You do not belong to these parts," she said again. "You speak like an educated man."

"I believe I have a right to that name," said I, "although in this disguise."

But her woman's eye had already detected the sash.

"Oh!" she said; "your sash betrays you."

"You have said the word betray," I resumed. "May I ask you not to betray me? I was obliged to disclose myself in your interest; but if Northmour learned my presence it might be worse than disagreeable for me."

"Do you know," she asked, "to whom you are speaking?"

"Not to Mr. Northmour's wife?" I asked, by way of answer.

She shook her head. All this while she was studying my face with an embarrassing intentness. Then she broke out—

"You have an honest face. Be honest like your face, sir, and tell me what you want and what you are afraid of. Do you think I could hurt you? I believe you have far more power to injure me! And yet you do not look unkind. What do you mean—you, a gentleman—by skulking like a spy about this desolate place? Tell me," she said, "who is it you hate?"

"I hate no one," I answered; "and I fear no one face to face. My name is Cassilis—Frank Cassilis. I lead the life of a vagabond for my own good pleasure. I am one of Northmour's oldest friends; and three nights ago, when I addressed him on these links, he stabbed me in the shoulder with a knife."

"It was you!" she said.

"Why he did so," I continued, disregarding the interruption, "is more than I can guess, and more than I care to know. I have not many friends, nor am I very susceptible to friendship; but no man shall drive me from a place by terror. I had camped in the Graden Sea-Wood ere he came; I camp in it still. If you think I mean harm to you or yours, madame, the remedy is in your hand. Tell him that my camp is in the Hemlock Den, and to-night he can stab me in safety while I sleep."

With this I doffed my cap to her, and scrambled up once more among the sand hills. I do not know why, but I felt a prodigious sense of injustice, and felt like a hero and a martyr; while as a matter of fact, I had not a word to say in my defense, nor so much as one plausible reason to offer for my conduct. I had stayed at Graden out of a curiosity natural enough, but undignified; and though there was another motive growing in along with the first, it was not one which, at that period, I could have properly explained to the lady of my heart.

Certainly, that night, I thought of no one else; and, though her whole conduct and position seemed suspicious, I could not find it in my heart to entertain a doubt of her integrity. I could have staked my life that she was clear of blame, and, though all was dark at the present, that the explanation of the mystery would show her part in these events to be both right and needful. It was true, let me cudgel my imagination as I pleased, that I could invent no theory of her relations to Northmour; but I felt none the less sure of my conclusion because it was founded on instinct in place of reason, and, as I may say, went to sleep that night with the thought of her under my pillow.

Next day she came out about the same hour alone, and, as soon as the sand hills concealed her from the pavilion, drew nearer to the edge, and called me by name in guarded tones. I was astonished to observe that she was deadly pale, and seemingly under the influence of strong emotion.

"Mr. Cassilis!" she cried; "Mr. Cassilis!"

I appeared at once, and leaped down upon the beach. A remarkable air of relief overspread her countenance as soon as she saw me.

"Oh!" she cried, with a hoarse sound, like one whose bosom had been lightened of a weight. And then, "Thank God you are still safe!" she added; "I knew, if you were, you would be here." (Was not this strange? So swiftly and wisely does Nature prepare our hearts for these great lifelong intimacies, that both my wife and I had been given a presentiment on this the second day of our acquaintance. I had even then hoped that she would seek me; she had felt sure that she would find me.) "Do not," she went on swiftly, "do not stay in this place. Promise me that you sleep no longer in that wood. You do not know how I suffer; all last night I could not sleep for thinking of your peril."

"Peril!" I repeated. "Peril from whom? From Northmour?"

"Not so," she said. "Did you think I would tell him after what you said?"

"Not from Northmour?" I repeated. "Then how? From whom? I see none to be afraid of."

"You must not ask me," was her reply, "for I am not free to tell you. Only believe me, and go hence—believe me, and go away quickly, quickly, for your life!"

An appeal to his alarm is never a good plan to rid oneself of a spirited young man. My obstinacy was but increased by what she said, and I made it a point of honor to remain. And her solicitude for my safety still more confirmed me in the resolve.

"You must not think me inquisitive, madame," I replied, "but, if Graden is so dangerous a place, you yourself perhaps remain here at some risk."

She only looked at me reproachfully.

"You and your father—" I resumed; but she interrupted me almost with a gasp.

"My father! How do you know that?" she cried.

"I saw you together when you landed," was my answer; and I do not know why, but it seemed satisfactory to both of us, as indeed it was truth. "But," I continued, "you need have no fear from me. I see you have some reason to be secret, and, you may believe me, your secret is as safe with me as if I were in Graden Floe. I have scarce spoken to anyone for years; my horse is my only companion, and even he, poor beast, is not beside me. You see, then, you may count on me for silence. So tell me the truth, my dear young lady, are you not in danger?"

"Mr. Northmour says you are an honorable man," she returned, "and I believe it when I see you. I will tell you so much; you are right: we are in dreadful, dreadful danger, and you share it by remaining where you are."

"Ah!" said I; "you have heard of me from Northmour? And he gives me a good character?"

"I asked him about you last night," was her reply. "I pretended," she hesitated, "I pretended to have met you long ago, and spoken to you of him. It was not true; but I could not help myself without betraying you, and you had put me in a difficulty. He praised you highly."

"And—you may permit me one question—does this danger come from Northmour?" I asked.

"From Mr. Northmour?" she cried. "Oh, no, he stays with us to share it."

"While you propose that I should run away?" I said. "You do not rate me very high."

"Why should you stay?" she asked. "You are no friend of ours."

I know not what came over me, for I had not been conscious of a similar weakness since I was a child, but I was so mortified by this retort that my eyes pricked and filled with tears, as I continued to gaze upon her face.

"No, no," she said, in a changed voice; "I did not mean the words unkindly."

"It was I who offended," I said; and I held out my hand with a look of appeal that somehow touched her, for she gave me hers at once, and even eagerly. I held it for awhile in mine, and gazed into her eyes. It was she who first tore her hand away, and, forgetting all about her request and the promise she had sought to extort, ran at the top of her speed, and without turning, till she was out of sight. And then I knew that I loved her, and thought in my glad heart that she—she herself—was not indifferent to my suit. Many a time she has denied it in after days, but it was with a smiling and not a serious denial. For my part, I am sure our hands would not have lain so closely in each other if she had not begun to melt to me already. And, when all is said, it is no great contention, since, by her own avowal, she began to love me on the morrow.

And yet on the morrow very little took place. She came and called me down as on the day before, upbraided me for lingering at Graden, and, when she found I was still obdurate, began to ask me more particularly as to my arrival. I told her by what series of accidents I had come to witness their disembarkation, and how I had determined to remain, partly from the interest which had been awakened in me by Northmour's guests, and partly because of his own murderous attack. As to the former, I fear I was disingenuous, and led her to regard herself as having been an attraction to me from the first moment that I saw her on the links. It relieves my heart to make this confession even now, when my wife is with God, and already knows all things, and the honesty of my purpose even in this; for while she lived, although it often pricked my conscience, I had never the hardihood to undeceive her. Even a little secret, in such a married life as ours, is like the rose leaf which kept the princess from her sleep.

From this the talk branched into other subjects, and I told her much about my lonely and wandering existence; she, for her part, giving ear, and saying little. Although we spoke very naturally, and latterly on topics that might seem indifferent, we were both sweetly agitated. Too soon it was time for her to go; and we separated, as if by mutual consent, without shaking hands, for both knew that, between us, it was no idle ceremony.

The next, and that was the fourth day of our acquaintance, we met in the same spot, but early in the morning, with much familiarity and yet much timidity on either side. While she had once more spoken about my danger—and that, I understood, was her excuse for coming—I, who had prepared a great deal of talk during the night, began to tell her how highly I valued her kind interest, and how no one had ever cared to hear about my life, nor had I ever cared to relate it, before yesterday. Suddenly she interrupted me, saying with vehemence—

"And yet, if you knew who I was, you would not so much as speak to me!"

I told her such a thought was madness, and, little as we had met, I counted her already a dear friend; but my protestations seemed only to make her more desperate.

"My father is in hiding!" she cried.

"My dear," I said, forgetting for the first time to add "young lady," "what do I care? If I were in hiding twenty times over, would it make one thought of change in you?"

"Ah, but the cause!" she cried, "the cause! It is"—she faltered for a second—"it is disgraceful to us!"
IV

This was my wife's story, as I drew it from her among tears and sobs. Her name was Clara Huddlestone: it sounded very beautiful in my ears; but not so beautiful as that other name of Clara Cassilis, which she wore during the longer and, I thank God, the happier portion of her life. Her father, Bernard Huddlestone, had been a private banker in a very large way of business. Many years before, his affairs becoming disordered, he had been led to try dangerous, and at last criminal, expedients to retrieve himself from ruin. All was in vain; he became more and more cruelly involved, and found his honor lost at the same moment with his fortune. About this period, Northmour had been courting his daughter with great assiduity, though with small encouragement; and to him, knowing him thus disposed in his favor, Bernard Huddlestone turned for help in his extremity. It was not merely ruin and dishonor, nor merely a legal condemnation, that the unhappy man had brought upon his head. It seems he could have gone to prison with a light heart. What he feared, what kept him awake at night or recalled him from slumber into frenzy, was some secret, sudden, and unlawful attempt upon his life. Hence, he desired to bury his existence and escape to one of the islands in the South Pacific, and it was in Northmour's yacht, the "Red Earl," that he designed to go. The yacht picked them up clandestinely upon the coast of Wales, and had once more deposited them at Graden, till she could be refitted and provisioned for the longer voyage. Nor could Clara doubt that her hand had been stipulated as the price of passage. For, although Northmour was neither unkind, nor even discourteous, he had shown himself in several instances somewhat overbold in speech and manner.

I listened, I need not say, with fixed attention, and put many questions as to the more mysterious part. It was in vain. She had no clear idea of what the blow was, nor of how it was expected to fall. Her father's alarm was unfeigned and physically prostrating, and he had thought more than once of making an unconditional surrender to the police. But the scheme was finally abandoned, for he was convinced that not even the strength of our English prisons could shelter him from his pursuers. He had had many affairs in Italy, and with Italians resident in London, in the latter years of his business; and these last, as Clara fancied, were somehow connected with the doom that threatened him. He had shown great terror at the presence of an Italian seaman on board the "Red Earl," and had bitterly and repeatedly accused Northmour in consequence. The latter had protested that Beppo (that was the seaman's name) was a capital fellow, and could be trusted to the death; but Mr. Huddlestone had continued ever since to declare that all was lost, that it was only a question of days, and that Beppo would be the ruin of him yet.

I regarded the whole story as the hallucination of a mind shaken by calamity. He had suffered heavy loss by his Italian transactions; and hence the sight of an Italian was hateful to him, and the principal part in his nightmare would naturally enough be played by one of that nation.

"What your father wants," I said, "is a good doctor and some calming medicine."

"But Mr. Northmour?" objected Clara. "He is untroubled by losses, and yet he shares in this terror."

I could not help laughing at what I considered her simplicity.

"My dear," said I, "you have told me yourself what reward he has to look for. All is fair in love, you must remember; and if Northmour foments your father's terrors, it is not at all because he is afraid of any Italian man, but simply because he is infatuated with a charming English woman."

She reminded me of his attack upon myself on the night of the disembarkation, and this I was unable to explain. In short, and from one thing to another, it was agreed between us that I should set out at once for the fisher village, Graden Wester, as it was called, look up all the newspapers I could find, and see for myself if there seemed any basis of fact for these continued alarms. The next morning, at the same hour and place, I was to make my report to Clara. She said no more on that occasion about my departure; nor, indeed, did she make it a secret that she clung to the thought of my proximity as something helpful and pleasant; and, for my part, I could not have left her, if she had gone upon her knees to ask it.

I reached Graden Wester before ten in the forenoon; for in those days I was an excellent pedestrian, and the distance, as I think I have said, was little over seven miles; fine walking all the way upon the springy turf. The village is one of the bleakest on that coast, which is saying much: there is a church in the hollow; a miserable haven in the rocks, where many boats have been lost as they returned from fishing; two or three score of stone houses arranged along the beach and in two streets, one leading from the harbor, and another striking out from it at right angles; and, at the corner of these two, a very dark and cheerless tavern, by way of principal hotel.

I had dressed myself somewhat more suitably to my station in life, and at once called upon the minister in his little manse beside the graveyard. He knew me, although it was more than nine years since we had met; and when I told him that I had been long upon a walking tour, and was behind with the news, readily lent me an armful of newspapers, dating from a month back to the day before. With these I sought the tavern, and, ordering some breakfast, sat down to study the "Huddlestone Failure."

It had been, it appeared, a very flagrant case. Thousands of persons were reduced to poverty; and one in particular had blown out his brains as soon as payment was suspended. It was strange to myself that, while I read these details, I continued rather to sympathize with Mr. Huddlestone than with his victims; so complete already was the empire of my love for my wife. A price was naturally set upon the banker's head; and, as the case was inexcusable and the public indignation thoroughly aroused, the unusual figure of £750 was offered for his capture. He was reported to have large sums of money in his possession. One day, he had been heard of in Spain; the next, there was sure intelligence that he was still lurking between Manchester and Liverpool, or along the border of Wales; and the day after, a telegram would announce his arrival in Cuba or Yucatan. But in all this there was no word of an Italian, nor any sign of mystery.

In the very last paper, however, there was one item not so clear. The accountants who were charged to verify the failure had, it seemed, come upon the traces of a very large number of thousands, which figured for some time in the transactions of the house of Huddlestone; but which came from nowhere, and disappeared in the same mysterious fashion. It was only once referred to by name, and then under the initials "X.X."; but it had plainly been floated for the first time into the business at a period of great depression some six years ago. The name of a distinguished royal personage had been mentioned by rumor in connection with this sum. "The cowardly desperado"—such, I remember, was the editorial expression—was supposed to have escaped with a large part of this mysterious fund still in his possession.

I was still brooding over the fact, and trying to torture it into some connection with Mr. Huddlestone's danger, when a man entered the tavern and asked for some bread and cheese with a decided foreign accent.

"Siete Italiano?" said I.

"Si, Signor," was his reply.

I said it was unusually far north to find one of his compatriots; at which he shrugged his shoulders, and replied that a man would go anywhere to find work. What work he could hope to find at Graden Wester, I was totally unable to conceive; and the incident struck so unpleasantly upon my mind, that I asked the landlord, while he was counting me some change, whether he had ever before seen an Italian in the village. He said he had once seen some Norwegians, who had been shipwrecked on the other side of Graden Ness and rescued by the lifeboat from Cauldhaven.

"No!" said I; "but an Italian, like the man who has just had bread and cheese."

"What?" cried he, "yon black-avised fellow wi' the teeth? Was he an I-talian? Weel, yon's the first that ever I saw, an' I dare say he's like to be the last."

Even as he was speaking, I raised my eyes, and, casting a glance into the street, beheld three men in earnest conversation together, and not thirty yards away. One of them was my recent companion in the tavern parlor; the other two, by their handsome sallow features and soft hats, should evidently belong to the same race. A crowd of village children stood around them, gesticulating and talking gibberish in imitation. The trio looked singularly foreign to the bleak dirty street in which they were standing and the dark gray heaven that overspread them; and I confess my incredulity received at that moment a shock from which it never recovered. I might reason with myself as I pleased, but I could not argue down the effect of what I had seen, and I began to share in the Italian terror.

It was already drawing toward the close of the day before I had returned the newspapers to the manse, and got well forward on to the links on my way home. I shall never forget that walk. It grew very cold and boisterous; the wind sung in the short grass about my feet; thin rain showers came running on the gusts; and an immense mountain range of clouds began to arise out of the bosom of the sea. It would be hard to imagine a more dismal evening; and whether it was from these external influences, or because my nerves were already affected by what I had heard and seen, my thoughts were as gloomy as the weather.

The upper windows of the pavilion commanded a considerable spread of links in the direction of Graden Wester. To avoid observation, it was necessary to hug the beach until I had gained cover from the higher sand hills on the little headland, when I might strike across, through the hollows, for the margin of the wood. The sun was about setting; the tide was low, and all the quicksands uncovered; and I was moving along, lost in unpleasant thought, when I was suddenly thunderstruck to perceive the prints of human feet. They ran parallel to my own course, but low down upon the beach, instead of along the border of the turf; and, when I examined them, I saw at once, by the size and coarseness of the impression, that it was a stranger to me and to those of the pavilion who had recently passed that way. Not only so; but from the recklessness of the course which he had followed, steering near to the most formidable portions of the sand, he was evidently a stranger to the country and to the ill-repute of Graden beach.

Step by step I followed the prints; until, a quarter of a mile farther, I beheld them die away into the southeastern boundary of Graden Floe. There, whoever he was, the miserable man had perished. One or two gulls, who had, perhaps, seen him disappear, wheeled over his sepulcher with their usual melancholy piping. The sun had broken through the clouds by a last effort, and colored the wide level of quicksands with a dusky purple. I stood for some time gazing at the spot, chilled and disheartened by my own reflections, and with a strong and commanding consciousness of death. I remember wondering how long the tragedy had taken, and whether his screams had been audible at the pavilion. And then, making a strong resolution, I was about to tear myself away, when a gust fiercer than usual fell upon this quarter of the beach, and I saw, now whirling high in air, now skimming lightly across the surface of the sands, a soft, black, felt hat, somewhat conical in shape, such as I had remarked already on the heads of the Italians.

I believe, but I am not sure, that I uttered a cry. The wind was driving the hat shoreward, and I ran round the border of the floe to be ready against its arrival. The gust fell, dropping the hat for awhile upon the quicksand, and then, once more freshening, landed it a few yards from where I stood. I seized it with the interest you may imagine. It had seen some service; indeed, it was rustier than either of those I had seen that day upon the street. The lining was red, stamped with the name of the maker, which I have forgotten, and that of the place of manufacture, Venedig. This (it is not yet forgotten) was the name given by the Austrians to the beautiful city of Venice, then, and for long after, a part of their dominions.

The shock was complete. I saw imaginary Italians upon every side; and for the first, and, I may say, for the last time in my experience, became overpowered by what is called a panic terror. I knew nothing, that is, to be afraid of, and yet I admit that I was heartily afraid; and it was with sensible reluctance that I returned to my exposed and solitary camp in the Sea-Wood.

There I eat some cold porridge which had been left over from the night before, for I was disinclined to make a fire; and, feeling strengthened and reassured, dismissed all these fanciful terrors from my mind, and lay down to sleep with composure.

How long I may have slept it is impossible for me to guess; but I was awakened at last by a sudden, blinding flash of light into my face. It woke me like a blow. In an instant I was upon my knees. But the light had gone as suddenly as it came. The darkness was intense. And, as it was blowing great guns from the sea, and pouring with rain, the noises of the storm effectually concealed all others.

It was, I dare say, half a minute before I regained my self-possession. But for two circumstances, I should have thought I had been awakened by some new and vivid form of nightmare. First, the flap of my tent, which I had shut carefully when I retired, was now unfastened; and, second, I could still perceive, with a sharpness that excluded any theory of hallucination, the smell of hot metal and of burning oil. The conclusion was obvious. I had been awakened by some one flashing a bull's-eye lantern in my face. It had been but a flash, and away. He had seen my face, and then gone. I asked myself the object of so strange a proceeding, and the answer came pat. The man, whoever he was, had thought to recognize me, and he had not. There was another question unresolved; and to this, I may say, I feared to give an answer; if he had recognized me, what would he have done?

My fears were immediately diverted from myself, for I saw that I had been visited in a mistake; and I became persuaded that some dreadful danger threatened the pavilion. It required some nerve to issue forth into the black and intricate thicket which surrounded and overhung the den; but I groped my way to the links, drenched with rain, beaten upon and deafened by the gusts, and fearing at every step to lay my hand upon some lurking adversary. The darkness was so complete that I might have been surrounded by an army and yet none the wiser, and the uproar of the gale so loud that my hearing was as useless as my sight.

For the rest of that night, which seemed interminably long, I patrolled the vicinity of the pavilion, without seeing a living creature or hearing any noise but the concert of the wind, the sea, and the rain. A light in the upper story filtered through a cranny of the shutter, and kept me company till the approach of dawn.
V

With the first peep of day, I retired from the open to my old lair among the sand hills, there to await the coming of my wife. The morning was gray, wild, and melancholy; the wind moderated before sunrise, and then went about, and blew in puffs from the shore; the sea began to go down, but the rain still fell without mercy. Over all the wilderness of links there was not a creature to be seen. Yet I felt sure the neighborhood was alive with skulking foes. The light that had been so suddenly and surprisingly flashed upon my face as I lay sleeping, and the hat that had been blown ashore by the wind from over Graden Floe, were two speaking signals of the peril that environed Clara and the party in the pavilion.

It was, perhaps, half-past seven, or nearer eight, before I saw the door open, and that dear figure come toward me in the rain. I was waiting for her on the beach before she had crossed the sand hills.

"I have had such trouble to come!" she cried. "They did not wish me to go walking in the rain."

"Clara," I said, "you are not frightened!"

"No," said she, with a simplicity that filled my heart with confidence. For my wife was the bravest as well as the best of women; in my experience, I have not found the two go always together, but with her they did; and she combined the extreme of fortitude with the most endearing and beautiful virtues.

I told her what had happened; and, though her cheek grew visibly paler, she retained perfect control over her senses.

"You see now that I am safe," said I, in conclusion. "They do not mean to harm me; for, had they chosen, I was a dead man last night."

She laid her hand upon my arm.

"And I had no presentiment!" she cried.

Her accent thrilled me with delight. I put my arm about her, and strained her to my side; and, before either of us was aware, her hands were on my shoulders and my lips upon her mouth. Yet up to that moment no word of love had passed between us. To this day I remember the touch of her cheek, which was wet and cold with the rain; and many a time since, when she has been washing her face, I have kissed it again for the sake of that morning on the beach. Now that she is taken from me, and I finish my pilgrimage alone, I recall our old loving kindnesses and the deep honesty and affection which united us, and my present loss seems but a trifle in comparison.

We may have thus stood for some seconds—for time passes quickly with lovers—before we were startled by a peal of laughter close at hand. It was not natural mirth, but seemed to be affected in order to conceal an angrier feeling. We both turned, though I still kept my left arm about Clara's waist; nor did she seek to withdraw herself; and there, a few paces off upon the beach, stood Northmour, his head lowered, his hands behind his back, his nostrils white with passion.

"Ah! Cassilis!" he said, as I disclosed my face.

"That same," said I; for I was not at all put about.

"And so, Miss Huddlestone," he continued slowly, but savagely, "this is how you keep your faith to your father and to me? This is the value you set upon your father's life? And you are so infatuated with this young gentleman that you must brave ruin, and decency, and common human caution—"

"Miss Huddlestone—" I was beginning to interrupt him, when he, in his turn, cut in brutally—

"You hold your tongue," said he; "I am speaking to that girl."

"That girl, as you call her, is my wife," said I; and my wife only leaned a little nearer, so that I knew she had affirmed my words.

"Your what?" he cried. "You lie!"

"Northmour," I said, "we all know you have a bad temper, and I am the last man to be irritated by words. For all that, I propose that you speak lower, for I am convinced that we are not alone."

He looked round him, and it was plain my remark had in some degree sobered his passion. "What do you mean?" he asked.

I only said one word: "Italians."

He swore a round oath, and looked at us, from one to the other.

"Mr. Cassilis knows all that I know," said my wife.

"What I want to know," he broke out, "is where the devil Mr. Cassilis comes from, and what the devil Mr. Cassilis is doing here. You say you are married; that I do not believe. If you were, Graden Floe would soon divorce you; four minutes and a half, Cassilis. I keep my private cemetery for my friends."

"It took somewhat longer," said I, "for that Italian."

He looked at me for a moment half daunted, and then, almost civilly, asked me to tell my story. "You have too much the advantage of me, Cassilis," he added. I complied of course; and he listened, with several ejaculations, while I told him how I had come to Graden: that it was I whom he had tried to murder on the night of landing; and what I had subsequently seen and heard of the Italians.

"Well," said he, when I had done, "it is here at last; there is no mistake about that. And what, may I ask, do you propose to do?"

"I propose to stay with you and lend a hand," said I.

"You are a brave man," he returned, with a peculiar intonation.

"I am not afraid," said I.

"And so," he continued, "I am to understand that you two are married? And you stand up to it before my face, Miss Huddlestone?"

"We are not yet married," said Clara; "but we shall be as soon as we can."

"Bravo!" cried Northmour. "And the bargain? D——n it, you're not a fool, young woman; I may call a spade a spade with you. How about the bargain? You know as well as I do what your father's life depends upon. I have only to put my hands under my coat tails and walk away, and his throat would be cut before the evening."

"Yes, Mr. Northmour," returned Clara, with great spirit; "but that is what you will never do. You made a bargain that was unworthy of a gentleman; but you are a gentleman for all that, and you will never desert a man whom you have begun to help."

"Aha!" said he. "You think I will give my yacht for nothing? You think I will risk my life and liberty for love of the old gentleman; and then, I suppose, be best man at the wedding, to wind up? Well," he added, with an odd smile, "perhaps you are not altogether wrong. But ask Cassilis here. He knows me. Am I a man to trust? Am I safe and scrupulous? Am I kind?"

"I know you talk a great deal, and sometimes, I think, very foolishly," replied Clara, "but I know you are a gentleman, and I am not the least afraid."

He looked at her with a peculiar approval and admiration; then, turning to me, "Do you think I would give her up without a struggle, Frank?" said he. "I tell you plainly, you look out. The next time we come to blows—"

"Will make the third," I interrupted, smiling.

"Aye, true; so it will," he said. "I had forgotten. Well, the third time's lucky."

"The third time, you mean, you will have the crew of the 'Red Earl' to help," I said.

"Do you hear him?" he asked, turning to my wife.

"I hear two men speaking like cowards," said she. "I should despise myself either to think or speak like that. And neither of you believe one word that you are saying, which makes it the more wicked and silly."

"She's a trump!" cried Northmour. "But she's not yet Mrs. Cassilis. I say no more. The present is not for me."

Then my wife surprised me.

"I leave you here," she said suddenly. "My father has been too long alone. But remember this: you are to be friends, for you are both good friends to me."

She has since told me her reason for this step. As long as she remained, she declares that we two would have continued to quarrel; and I suppose that she was right, for when she was gone we fell at once into a sort of confidentiality.

Northmour stared after her as she went away over the sand hill.

"She is the only woman in the world!" he exclaimed with an oath. "Look at her action."

I, for my part, leaped at this opportunity for a little further light.

"See here, Northmour," said I; "we are all in a tight place, are we not?"

"I believe you, my boy," he answered, looking me in the eyes, and with great emphasis. "We have all hell upon us, that's the truth. You may believe me or not, but I'm afraid of my life."

"Tell me one thing," said I. "What are they after, these Italians? What do they want with Mr. Huddlestone?"

"Don't you know?" he cried. "The black old scamp had carbonari funds on a deposit—two hundred and eighty thousand; and of course he gambled it away on stocks. There was to have been a revolution in the Tridentino, or Parma; but the revolution is off, and the whole wasp's nest is after Huddlestone. We shall all be lucky if we can save our skins."

"The carbonari!" I exclaimed; "God help him indeed!"

"Amen!" said Northmour. "And now, look here: I have said that we are in a fix; and, frankly, I shall be glad of your help. If I can't save Huddlestone, I want at least to save the girl. Come and stay in the pavilion; and, there's my hand on it, I shall act as your friend until the old man is either clear or dead. But," he added, "once that is settled, you become my rival once again, and I warn you—mind yourself."

"Done!" said I; and we shook hands.

"And now let us go directly to the fort," said Northmour; and he began to lead the way through the rain.
VI

We were admitted to the pavilion by Clara, and I was surprised by the completeness and security of the defenses. A barricade of great strength, and yet easy to displace, supported the door against any violence from without; and the shutters of the dining-room, into which I was led directly, and which was feebly illuminated by a lamp, were even more elaborately fortified. The panels were strengthened by bars and crossbars; and these, in their turn, were kept in position by a system of braces and struts, some abutting on the floor, some on the roof, and others, in fine, against the opposite wall of the apartment. It was at once a solid and well-designed piece of carpentry; and I did not seek to conceal my admiration.

"I am the engineer," said Northmour. "You remember the planks in the garden? Behold them?"

"I did not know you had so many talents," said I.

"Are you armed?" he continued, pointing to an array of guns and pistols, all in admirable order, which stood in line against the wall or were displayed upon the sideboard.

"Thank you," I returned; "I have gone armed since our last encounter. But, to tell you the truth, I have had nothing to eat since early yesterday evening."

Northmour produced some cold meat, to which I eagerly set myself, and a bottle of good Burgundy, by which, wet as I was, I did not scruple to profit. I have always been an extreme temperance man on principle; but it is useless to push principle to excess, and on this occasion I believe that I finished three quarters of the bottle. As I eat, I still continued to admire the preparations for defense.

"We could stand a siege," I said at length.

"Ye—es," drawled Northmour; "a very little one, per—haps. It is not so much the strength of the pavilion I misdoubt; it is the double danger that kills me. If we get to shooting, wild as the country is, some one is sure to hear it, and then—why then it's the same thing, only different, as they say: caged by law, or killed by carbonari. There's the choice. It is a devilish bad thing to have the law against you in this world, and so I tell the old gentleman upstairs. He is quite of my way of thinking."

"Speaking of that," said I, "what kind of person is he?"

"Oh, he!" cried the other; "he's a rancid fellow, as far as he goes. I should like to have his neck wrung to-morrow by all the devils in Italy. I am not in this affair for him. You take me? I made a bargain for missy's hand, and I mean to have it too."

"That, by the way," said I. "I understand. But how will Mr. Huddlestone take my intrusion?"

"Leave that to Clara," returned Northmour.

I could have struck him in the face for his coarse familiarity; but I respected the truce, as, I am bound to say, did Northmour, and so long as the danger continued not a cloud arose in our relation. I bear him this testimony with the most unfeigned satisfaction; nor am I without pride when I look back upon my own behavior. For surely no two men were ever left in a position so invidious and irritating.

As soon as I had done eating, we proceeded to inspect the lower floor. Window by window we tried the different supports, now and then making an inconsiderable change; and the strokes of the hammer sounded with startling loudness through the house. I proposed, I remember, to make loop-holes; but he told me they were already made in the windows of the upper story. It was an anxious business, this inspection, and left me down-hearted. There were two doors and five windows to protect, and, counting Clara, only four of us to defend them against an unknown number of foes. I communicated my doubts to Northmour, who assured me, with unmoved composure, that he entirely shared them.

"Before morning," said he, "we shall all be butchered and buried in Graden Floe. For me, that is written."

I could not help shuddering at the mention of the quicksand, but reminded Northmour that our enemies had spared me in the wood.

"Do not flatter yourself," said he. "Then you were not in the same boat with the old gentleman; now you are. It's the floe for all of us, mark my words."

I trembled for Clara; and just then her dear voice was heard calling us to come upstairs. Northmour showed me the way, and, when he had reached the landing, knocked at the door of what used to be called My Uncle's Bedroom, as the founder of the pavilion had designed it especially for himself.

"Come in, Northmour; come in, dear Mr. Cassilis," said a voice from within.

Pushing open the door, Northmour admitted me before him into the apartment. As I came in I could see the daughter slipping out by the side door into the study, which had been prepared as her bedroom. In the bed, which was drawn back against the wall, instead of standing, as I had last seen it, boldly across the window, sat Bernard Huddlestone, the defaulting banker. Little as I had seen of him by the shifting light of the lantern on the links, I had no difficulty in recognizing him for the same. He had a long and sallow countenance, surrounded by a long red beard and side-whiskers. His broken nose and high cheek-bones gave him somewhat the air of a Kalmuck, and his light eyes shone with the excitement of a high fever. He wore a skull-cap of black silk; a huge Bible lay open before him on the bed, with a pair of gold spectacles in the place, and a pile of other books lay on the stand by his side. The green curtains lent a cadaverous shade to his cheek; and, as he sat propped on pillows, his great stature was painfully hunched, and his head protruded till it overhung his knees. I believe if he had not died otherwise, he must have fallen a victim to consumption in the course of but a very few weeks.

He held out to me a hand, long, thin, and disagreeably hairy.

"Come in, come in, Mr. Cassilis," said he. "Another protector—ahem!—another protector. Always welcome as a friend of my daughter's, Mr. Cassilis. How they have rallied about me, my daughter's friends! May God in heaven bless and reward them for it!"

I gave him my hand, of course, because I could not help it; but the sympathy I had been prepared to feel for Clara's father was immediately soured by his appearance, and the wheedling, unreal tones in which he spoke.

"Cassilis is a good man," said Northmour; "worth ten."

"So I hear," cried Mr. Huddlestone eagerly; "so my girl tells me. Ah, Mr. Cassilis, my sin has found me out, you see! I am very low, very low; but I hope equally penitent. We must all come to the throne of grace at last, Mr. Cassilis. For my part, I come late indeed; but with unfeigned humility, I trust."

"Fiddle-de-dee!" said Northmour roughly.

"No, no, dear Northmour!" cried the banker. "You must not say that; you must not try to shake me. You forget, my dear, good boy, you forget I may be called this very night before my Maker."

His excitement was pitiful to behold; and I felt myself grow indignant with Northmour, whose infidel opinions I well knew, and heartily despised, as he continued to taunt the poor sinner out of his humor of repentance.

"Pooh, my dear Huddlestone!" said he. "You do yourself injustice. You are a man of the world inside and out, and were up to all kinds of mischief before I was born. Your conscience is tanned like South American leather—only you forgot to tan your liver, and that, if you will believe me, is the seat of the annoyance."

"Rogue, rogue! bad boy!" said Mr. Huddlestone, shaking his finger. "I am no precisian, if you come to that; I always hated a precisian; but I never lost hold of something better through it all. I have been a bad boy, Mr. Cassilis; I do not seek to deny that; but it was after my wife's death, and you know, with a widower, it's a different thing: sinful—I won't say no; but there is a gradation, we shall hope. And talking of that—Hark!" he broke out suddenly, his hand raised, his fingers spread, his face racked with interest and terror. "Only the rain, bless God!" he added, after a pause, and with indescribable relief.

For some seconds he lay back among the pillows like a man near to fainting; then he gathered himself together, and, in somewhat tremulous tones, began once more to thank me for the share I was prepared to take in his defense.

"One question, sir," said I, when he had paused. "Is it true that you have money with you?"

He seemed annoyed by the question, but admitted with reluctance that he had a little.

"Well," I continued, "it is their money they are after, is it not? Why not give it up to them?"

"Ah!" replied he, shaking his head, "I have tried that already, Mr. Cassilis; and alas! that it should be so, but it is blood they want."

"Huddlestone, that's a little less than fair," said Northmour. "You should mention that what you offered them was upward of two hundred thousand short. The deficit is worth a reference; it is for what they call a cool sum, Frank. Then, you see, the fellows reason in their clear Italian way; and it seems to them, as indeed it seems to me, that they may just as well have both while they're about it—money and blood together, by George, and no more trouble for the extra pleasure."

"Is it in the pavilion?" I asked.

"It is; and I wish it were in the bottom of the sea instead," said Northmour; and then suddenly—"What are you making faces at me for?" he cried to Mr. Huddlestone, on whom I had unconsciously turned my back. "Do you think Cassilis would sell you?"

Mr. Huddlestone protested that nothing had been further from his mind.

"It is a good thing," retorted Northmour in his ugliest manner. "You might end by wearying us. What were you going to say?" he added, turning to me.

"I was going to propose an occupation for the afternoon," said I. "Let us carry that money out, piece by piece, and lay it down before the pavilion door. If the carbonari come, why, it's theirs at any rate."

"No, no," cried Mr. Huddlestone; "it does not, it cannot, belong to them! It should be distributed pro rata among all my creditors."

"Come now, Huddlestone," said Northmour, "none of that."

"Well, but my daughter," moaned the wretched man.

"Your daughter will do well enough. Here are two suitors, Cassilis and I, neither of us beggars, between whom she has to choose. And as for yourself, to make an end of arguments, you have no right to a farthing, and, unless I'm much mistaken, you are going to die."

It was certainly very cruelly said; but Mr. Huddlestone was a man who attracted little sympathy; and, although I saw him wince and shudder, I mentally indorsed the rebuke; nay, I added a contribution of my own.

"Northmour and I," I said, "are willing enough to help you to save your life, but not to escape with stolen property."

He struggled for awhile with himself, as though he were on the point of giving way to anger, but prudence had the best of the controversy.

"My dear boys," he said, "do with me or my money what you will. I leave all in your hands. Let me compose myself."

And so we left him, gladly enough I am sure.

The last that I saw, he had once more taken up his great Bible, and with tremulous hands was adjusting his spectacles to read.
VII

The recollection of that afternoon will always be graven on my mind. Northmour and I were persuaded that an attack was imminent; and if it had been in our power to alter in any way the order of events, that power would have been used to precipitate rather than delay the critical moment. The worst was to be anticipated; yet we could conceive no extremity so miserable as the suspense we were now suffering. I have never been an eager, though always a great, reader; but I never knew books so insipid as those which I took up and cast aside that afternoon in the pavilion. Even talk became impossible, as the hours went on. One or other was always listening for some sound, or peering from an upstairs window over the links. And yet not a sign indicated the presence of our foes.

We debated over and over again my proposal with regard to the money; and had we been in complete possession of our faculties, I am sure we should have condemned it as unwise; but we were flustered with alarm, grasped at a straw, and determined, although it was as much as advertising Mr. Huddlestone's presence in the pavilion, to carry my proposal into effect.

The sum was part in specie, part in bank paper, and part in circular notes payable to the name of James Gregory. We took it out, counted it, inclosed it once more in a dispatch box belonging to Northmour, and prepared a letter in Italian which he tied to the handle. It was signed by both of us under oath, and declared that this was all the money which had escaped the failure of the house of Huddlestone. This was, perhaps, the maddest action ever perpetrated by two persons professing to be sane. Had the dispatch box fallen into other hands than those for which it was intended, we stood criminally convicted on our own written testimony; but, as I have said, we were neither of us in a condition to judge soberly, and had a thirst for action that drove us to do something, right or wrong, rather than endure the agony of waiting. Moreover, as we were both convinced that the hollows of the links were alive with hidden spies upon our movements, we hoped that our appearance with the box might lead to a parley, and, perhaps, a compromise.

It was nearly three when we issued from the pavilion. The rain had taken off; the sun shone quite cheerfully. I had never seen the gulls fly so close about the house or approach so fearlessly to human beings. On the very doorstep one flapped heavily past our heads, and uttered its wild cry in my very ear.

"There is an omen for you," said Northmour, who like all freethinkers was much under the influence of superstition. "They think we are already dead."

I made some light rejoinder, but it was with half my heart; for the circumstance had impressed me.

A yard or two before the gate, on a patch of smooth turf, we set down the dispatch box; and Northmour waved a white handkerchief over his head. Nothing replied. We raised our voices, and cried aloud in Italian that we were there as ambassadors to arrange the quarrel, but the stillness remained unbroken save by the seagulls and the surf. I had a weight at my heart when we desisted; and I saw that even Northmour was unusually pale. He looked over his shoulder nervously, as though he feared that some one had crept between him and the pavilion door.

"By God," he said in a whisper, "this is too much for me!"

I replied in the same key: "Suppose there should be none, after all!"

"Look there," he returned, nodding with his head, as though he had been afraid to point.

I glanced in the direction indicated; and there, from the northern quarter of the Sea-Wood, beheld a thin column of smoke rising steadily against the now cloudless sky.

"Northmour," I said (we still continued to talk in whispers), "it is not possible to endure this suspense. I prefer death fifty times over. Stay you here to watch the pavilion; I will go forward and make sure, if I have to walk right into their camp."

He looked once again all round him with puckered eyes, and then nodded assentingly to my proposal.

My heart beat like a sledge hammer as I set out walking rapidly in the direction of the smoke; and, though up to that moment I had felt chill and shivering, I was suddenly conscious of a glow of heat all over my body. The ground in this direction was very uneven; a hundred men might have lain hidden in as many square yards about my path. But I who had not practiced the business in vain, chose such routes as cut at the very root of concealment, and, by keeping along the most convenient ridges, commanded several hollows at a time. It was not long before I was rewarded for my caution. Coming suddenly on to a mound somewhat more elevated than the surrounding hummocks, I saw, not thirty yards away, a man bent almost double, and running as fast as his attitude permitted, along the bottom of a gully. I had dislodged one of the spies from his ambush. As soon as I sighted him, I called loudly both in English and Italian; and he, seeing concealment was no longer possible, straightened himself out, leaped from the gully, and made off as straight as an arrow for the borders of the wood. It was none of my business to pursue; I had learned what I wanted—that we were beleaguered and watched in the pavilion; and I returned at once, and walked as nearly as possible in my old footsteps, to where Northmour awaited me beside the dispatch box. He was even paler than when I had left him, and his voice shook a little.

"Could you see what he was like?" he asked.

"He kept his back turned," I replied.

"Let us get into the house, Frank. I don't think I'm a coward, but I can stand no more of this," he whispered.

All was still and sunshiny about the pavilion, as we turned to reenter it; even the gulls had flown in a wider circuit, and were seen flickering along the beach and sand hills; and this loneliness terrified me more than a regiment under arms. It was not until the door was barricaded that I could draw a full inspiration and relieve the weight that lay upon my bosom. Northmour and I exchanged a steady glance; and I suppose each made his own reflections on the white and startled aspect of the other.

"You were right," I said. "All is over. Shake hands, old man, for the last time."

"Yes," replied he, "I will shake hands; for, as sure as I am here, I bear no malice. But, remember, if, by some impossible accident, we should give the slip to these blackguards, I'll take the upper hand of you by fair or foul."

"Oh," said I, "you weary me!"

He seemed hurt, and walked away in silence to the foot of the stairs, where he paused.

"You do not understand," said he. "I am not a swindler, and I guard myself; that is all. I may weary you or not, Mr. Cassilis, I do not care a rush; I speak for my own satisfaction, and not for your amusement. You had better go upstairs and court the girl; for my part, I stay here."

"And I stay with you," I returned. "Do you think I would steal a march, even with your permission?"

"Frank," he said, smiling, "it's a pity you are an ass, for you have the makings of a man. I think I must be fey to-day; you cannot irritate me even when you try. Do you know," he continued softly, "I think we are the two most miserable men in England, you and I? we have got on to thirty without wife or child, or so much as a shop to look after—poor, pitiful, lost devils, both! And now we clash about a girl! As if there were not several millions in the United Kingdom! Ah, Frank, Frank, the one who loses his throw, be it you or me, he has my pity! It were better for him—how does the Bible say?—that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depth of the sea. Let us take a drink," he concluded suddenly, but without any levity of tone.

I was touched by his words, and consented. He sat down on the table in the dining-room, and held up the glass of sherry to his eye.

"If you beat me, Frank," he said, "I shall take to drink. What will you do, if it goes the other way?"

"God knows," I returned.

"Well," said he, "here is a toast in the meantime: 'Italia irredenta!'"

The remainder of the day was passed in the same dreadful tedium and suspense. I laid the table for dinner, while Northmour and Clara prepared the meal together in the kitchen. I could hear their talk as I went to and fro, and was surprised to find it ran all the time upon myself. Northmour again bracketed us together, and rallied Clara on a choice of husbands; but he continued to speak of me with some feeling, and uttered nothing to my prejudice unless he included himself in the condemnation. This awakened a sense of gratitude in my heart, which combined with the immediateness of our peril to fill my eyes with tears. After all, I thought—and perhaps the thought was laughably vain—we were here three very noble human beings to perish in defense of a thieving banker.

Before we sat down to table, I looked forth from an upstairs window. The day was beginning to decline; the links were utterly deserted; the dispatch box still lay untouched where we had left it hours before.

Mr. Huddlestone, in a long yellow dressing gown, took one end of the table, Clara the other; while Northmour and I faced each other from the sides. The lamp was brightly trimmed; the wine was good; the viands, although mostly cold, excellent of their sort. We seemed to have agreed tacitly; all reference to the impending catastrophe was carefully avoided; and, considering our tragic circumstances, we made a merrier party than could have been expected. From time to time, it is true, Northmour or I would rise from table and make a round of the defenses; and, on each of these occasions, Mr. Huddlestone was recalled to a sense of his tragic predicament, glanced up with ghastly eyes, and bore for an instant on his countenance the stamp of terror. But he hastened to empty his glass, wiped his forehead with his handkerchief, and joined again in the conversation.

I was astonished at the wit and information he displayed. Mr. Huddlestone's was certainly no ordinary character; he had read and observed for himself; his gifts were sound; and, though I could never have learned to love the man, I began to understand his success in business, and the great respect in which he had been held before his failure. He had, above all, the talent of society; and though I never heard him speak but on this one and most unfavorable occasion, I set him down among the most brilliant conversationalists I ever met.

He was relating with great gusto, and seemingly no feeling of shame, the maneuvers of a scoundrelly commission merchant whom he had known and studied in his youth, and we were all listening with an odd mixture of mirth and embarrassment, when our little party was brought abruptly to an end in the most startling manner.

A noise like that of a wet finger on the window pane interrupted Mr. Huddlestone's tale; and in an instant we were all four as white as paper, and sat tongue-tied and motionless round the table.

"A snail," I said at last; for I had heard that these animals make a noise somewhat similar in character.

"Snail be d——d!" said Northmour. "Hush!"

The same sound was repeated twice at regular intervals; and then a formidable voice shouted through the shutters the Italian word, "Traditore!"

Mr. Huddlestone threw his head in the air; his eyelids quivered; next moment he fell insensible below the table. Northmour and I had each run to the armory and seized a gun. Clara was on her feet with her hand at her throat.

So we stood waiting, for we thought the hour of attack was certainly come; but second passed after second, and all but the surf remained silent in the neighborhood of the pavilion.

"Quick," said Northmour; "upstairs with him before they come."
VIII

Somehow or other, by hook and crook, and between the three of us, we got Bernard Huddlestone bundled upstairs and laid upon the bed in My Uncle's Room. During the whole process, which was rough enough, he gave no sign of consciousness, and he remained, as we had thrown him, without changing the position of a finger. His daughter opened his shirt and began to wet his head and bosom; while Northmour and I ran to the window. The weather continued clear; the moon, which was now about full, had risen and shed a very clear light upon the links; yet, strain our eyes as we might, we could distinguish nothing moving. A few dark spots, more or less, on the uneven expanse were not to be identified; they might be crouching men, they might be shadows; it was impossible to be sure.

"Thank God," said Northmour, "Aggie is not coming to-night."

Aggie was the name of the old nurse; he had not thought of her until now; but that he should think of her at all was a trait that surprised me in the man.

We were again reduced to waiting. Northmour went to the fireplace and spread his hands before the red embers, as if he were cold. I followed him mechanically with my eyes, and in so doing turned my back upon the window. At that moment a very faint report was audible from without, and a ball shivered a pane of glass, and buried itself in the shutter two inches from my head. I heard Clara scream; and though I whipped instantly out of range and into a corner, she was there, so to speak, before me, beseeching to know if I were hurt. I felt that I could stand to be shot at every day and all day long, with such remarks of solicitude for a reward; and I continued to reassure her, with, the tenderest caresses and in complete forgetfulness of our situation, till the voice of Northmour recalled me to myself.

"An air gun," he said. "They wish to make no noise."

I put Clara aside, and looked at him. He was standing with his back to the fire and his hands clasped behind him; and I knew by the black look on his face, that passion was boiling within. I had seen just such a look before he attacked me, that March night, in the adjoining chamber; and, though I could make every allowance for his anger, I confess I trembled for the consequences. He gazed straight before him; but he could see us with the tail of his eye, and his temper kept rising like a gale of wind. With regular battle awaiting us outside, this prospect of an internecine strife within the walls began to daunt me.

Suddenly, as I was thus closely watching his expression and prepared against the worst, I saw a change, a flash, a look of relief, upon his face. He took up the lamp which stood beside him on the table, and turned to us with an air of some excitement.

"There is one point that we must know," said he. "Are they going to butcher the lot of us, or only Huddlestone? Did they take you for him, or fire at you for your own beaux yeux?"

"They took me for him, for certain," I replied. "I am near as tall, and my head is fair."

"I am going to make sure," returned Northmour; and he stepped up to the window, holding the lamp above his head, and stood there, quietly affronting death, for half a minute.

Clara sought to rush forward and pull him from the place of danger; but I had the pardonable selfishness to hold her back by force.

"Yes," said Northmour, turning coolly from the window, "it's only Huddlestone they want."

"Oh, Mr. Northmour!" cried Clara; but found no more to add; the temerity she had just witnessed seeming beyond, the reach of words.

He, on his part, looked at me, cocking his head, with a fire of triumph in his eyes; and I understood at once that he had thus hazarded his life, merely to attract Clara's notice, and depose me from my position as the hero of the hour. He snapped his fingers.

"The fire is only beginning," said he. "When they warm up to their work, they won't be so particular."

A voice was now heard hailing us from the entrance. From the window we could see the figure of a man in the moonlight; he stood motionless, his face uplifted to ours, and a rag of something white on his extended arm; and as we looked right down upon him, though he was a good many yards distant on the links, we could see the moonlight glitter on his eyes.

He opened his lips again, and spoke for some minutes on end, in a key so loud that he might have been heard in every corner of the pavilion, and as far away as the borders of the wood. It was the same voice that had already shouted, "Traditore!" through the shutters of the dining-room; this time it made a complete and clear statement. If the traitor "Oddlestone" were given up, all others should be spared; if not, no one should escape to tell the tale.

"Well, Huddlestone, what do you say to that?" asked Northmour, turning to the bed.

Up to that moment the banker had given no sign of life, and I, at least, had supposed him to be still lying in a faint; but he replied at once, and in such tones as I have never heard elsewhere, save from a delirious patient, adjured and besought us not to desert him. It was the most hideous and abject performance that my imagination can conceive.

"Enough," cried Northmour; and then he threw open the window, leaned out into the night, and in a tone of exultation, and with a total forgetfulness of what was due to the presence of a lady, poured out upon the ambassador a string of the most abominable raillery both in English and Italian, and bade him be gone where he had come from. I believe that nothing so delighted Northmour at that moment as the thought that we must all infallibly perish before the night was out.

Meantime, the Italian put his flag of truce into his pocket, and disappeared, at a leisurely pace, among the sand hills.

"They make honorable war," said Northmour. "They are all gentlemen and soldiers. For the credit of the thing, I wish we could change sides—you and I, Frank, and you, too, missy, my darling—and leave that being on the bed to some one else. Tut! Don't look shocked! We are all going post to what they call eternity, and may as well be above board while there's time. As far as I am concerned, if I could first strangle Huddlestone and then get Clara in my arms, I could die with some pride and satisfaction. And as it is, by God, I'll have a kiss!"

Before I could do anything to interfere, he had rudely embraced and repeatedly kissed the resisting girl. Next moment I had pulled him away with fury, and flung him heavily against the wall. He laughed loud and long, and I feared his wits had given way under the strain; for even in the best of days he had been a sparing and a quiet laugher.

"Now, Frank," said he, when his mirth was somewhat appeased, "it's your turn. Here's my hand. Good-bye, farewell!" Then, seeing me stand rigid and indignant, and holding Clara to my side—"Man!" he broke out, "are you angry? Did you think we were going to die with all the airs and graces of society? I took a kiss; I'm glad I did it; and now you can take another if you like, and square accounts."

I turned from him with a feeling of contempt which I did not seek to dissemble.

"As you please," said he. "You've been a prig in life; a prig you'll die."

And with that he sat down in a chair, a rifle over his knee, and amused himself with snapping the lock; but I could see that his ebullition of light spirits (the only one I ever knew him to display) had already come to an end, and was succeeded by a sullen, scowling humor.

All this time our assailants might have been entering the house, and we been none the wiser; we had in truth almost forgotten the danger that so imminently overhung our days. But just then Mr. Huddlestone uttered a cry, and leaped from the bed.

I asked him what was wrong.

"Fire!" he cried. "They have set the house on fire!"

Northmour was on his feet in an instant, and he and I ran through the door of communication with the study. The room was illuminated by a red and angry light. Almost at the moment of our entrance, a tower of flame arose in front of the window, and, with a tingling report, a pane fell inward on the carpet. They had set fire to the lean-to outhouse, where Northmour used to nurse his negatives.

"Hot work," said Northmour. "Let us try in your old room."

We ran thither in a breath, threw up the casement, and looked forth. Along the whole back wall of the pavilion piles of fuel had been arranged and kindled; and it is probable they had been drenched with mineral oil, for, in spite of the morning's rain, they all burned bravely. The fire had taken a firm hold already on the outhouse, which blazed higher and higher every moment; the back door was in the center of a red-hot bonfire; the eaves we could see, as we looked upward, were already smoldering, for the roof overhung, and was supported by considerable beams of wood. At the same time, hot, pungent, and choking volumes of smoke began to fill the house. There was not a human being to be seen to right or left.

"Ah, well!" said Northmour, "here's the end, thank God!"

And we returned to My Uncle's Room. Mr. Huddlestone was putting on his boots, still violently trembling, but with an air of determination such as I had not hitherto observed. Clara stood close by him, with her cloak in both hands ready to throw about her shoulders, and a strange look in her eyes, as if she were half hopeful, half doubtful of her father.

"Well, boys and girls," said Northmour, "how about a sally? The oven is heating; it is not good to stay here and be baked; and, for my part, I want to come to my hands with them, and be done."
 
"There's nothing else left," I replied. And both Clara and Mr. Huddlestone, though with a very different intonation, added, "Nothing."«»
